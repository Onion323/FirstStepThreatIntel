The newest CapraRAT APKs we identified now contain references to Android&#8217;s Oreo version (Android 8.0), which was released in 2017. Previous versions relied on the device running Lollipop (Android 5.1), which was released in 2015 and less likely to be compatible with modern Android devices.</p>\n<p>We tested the APKs from this campaign and the September 2023 campaign on an Android device running Android Tiramisu <i>aka</i> Android 13 (2022) and Android 14 (2023). The new campaign&#8217;s apps ran smoothly on this modern version of Android. The September 2023 campaign apps prompted a compatibility warning dialog, which could raise suspicion among victims that the app is abnormal. When running on the newest released version of Android 14, the September 2023 campaign&#8217;s Piya Sharma app fails to install. Each of the newer versions ran successfully.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the app still requests gratuitous permissions from the user that hint to the tool&#8217;s capabilities. Even if the user declines permissions, the app still runs, meaning the group has not overcome this hurdle to successfully implementing their spyware.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_100342\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100342\" style=\"width: 464px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_6.jpg\" alt=\"Piya Sharma app install failure dialog on Android 14\" width=\"464\" height=\"193\" class=\"size-full wp-image-100342\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_6.jpg 464w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_6-300x125.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-100342\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Piya Sharma app install failure dialog on Android 14</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new CapraRAT packages also contain a very minimal new class called <code>WebView</code>, which is responsible for maintaining compatibility with older versions of Android via the Android Support Library, which developers can choose to include in a project to enhance compatibility.</p>\n<h2>Spyware Activities and C2</h2>\n<p>The app’s <code>MainActivity</code> initiates requests for permissions. The app still runs even if permissions are not granted.</p>\n<p><code>MainActivity</code> calls the <code>TCHPClient</code> class, which contains the malicious capabilities leveraged by CapraRAT. This class drives several spyware classes and methods, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>audioStreamer</code> (<code>aStreamer</code>) </li>\n<li><code>CallLogLister</code></li>\n<li><code>CallReceiver</code></li>\n<li><code>ContactsLister</code></li>\n<li><code>DirLister</code> (file browsing)</li>\n<li><code>downloadFile</code></li>\n<li><code>killFile</code> (file deletion)</li>\n<li><code>killProcess</code></li>\n<li><code>PhotoTaker</code></li>\n<li><code>SMSLister</code> </li>\n<li><code>SMSReceiver</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These give the spyware fine-grained control over what the user does on the device.</p>\n<p>The <code>sendData</code> method is responsible for constructing the data collected by other methods and classes and sending it to the C2. The <code>mRun</code> method constructs the socket and sends the data to the C2 server using the variables specified in the <code>Settings</code> class. Each of the current campaign’s APKs use the same C2 server hostname, IP address and TCP port number 18582. The <code>Settings</code> class also shows the same CapraRAT version identifier for each APK, <code>A.D.0.2</code>.</p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_5.jpg\" alt=\"CapraRAT’s Settings class shows the tool’s configuration variables\" width=\"771\" height=\"766\" class=\"size-full wp-image-100343\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_5.jpg 771w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_5-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_5-768x763.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_5-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CapraMix_5-24x24.jpg 24w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px\" />\n<p><code>mRun</code> performs a connectivity check to decide whether to connect to the C2 using the hostname <code>shareboxs[.]net</code> or the hardcoded IP address <code>173[.]249[.]50[.]243</code>. This IP address has been tied to Transparent Tribe&#8217;s CrimsonRAT and AhMyth Android RAT C2 activity since at least 2022. As of this writing, <code>shareboxs[.]net</code> resolves to <code>173[.]212[.]206[.]227</code>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The updates to the CapraRAT code between the September 2023 campaign and the current campaign are minimal, but suggest the developers are focused on making the tool more reliable and stable. The decision to move to newer versions of the Android OS are logical, and likely align with the group’s sustained targeting of individuals in the Indian government or military space, who are unlikely to use devices running older versions of Android, such as Lollipop which was released 8 years ago.</p>\n<p>The APK theme updates show the group continues to lean into its social engineering prowess to gain a wider audience of targets who would be interested in the new app lures, such as mobile gamers or weapons enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>To help prevent compromise by CapraRAT and similar malware, users should always evaluate the permissions requested by an app to determine if they are necessary. For example, an app that only displays TikTok videos does not need the ability to send SMS messages, make calls, or record the screen. In incident response scenarios, treat the related network indicators of compromise as suspect, including the use of port 18582, and search suspect apps for the presence of strings using the unique method names outlined in the Spyware Activities &amp; C2 section of this report.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 70.0%; height: 24px;\"><strong>SHA1</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0%; height: 24px;\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 70.0%; height: 24px;\">28bc3b3d8878be4267ee08f20b7816a6ba23623e</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0%; height: 24px;\">TikTok signed.apk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 70.0%; height: 24px;\">c307f523a1d1aa928fe3db2c6c3ede6902f1084b</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0%; height: 24px;\">Crazy Game signed.apk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 70.0%; height: 24px;\">dba9f88ba548cebfa389972cddf2bec55b71168b</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0%; height: 24px;\">Sexy Videos signed.apk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 70.0%; height: 24px;\">fff24e9f11651e0bdbee7c5cd1034269f40fc424</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0%; height: 24px;\">Weapons signed.apk</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3>Network Indicators</h3>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\"><strong>Domain/IP</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\"><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">shareboxs[.]net</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">C2 domain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">173[.]212[.]206[.]227</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Resolved C2 IP address, hosts shareboxs.net</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">173[.]249[.]50[.]243</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Hardcoded failover C2 IP address</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n",

Each of the newer versions ran successfully.\nIn all cases, the app still requests gratuitous permissions from the user that hint to the tool’s capabilities. Even if the user declines permissions, the app still runs, meaning the group has not overcome this hurdle to successfully implementing their spyware.\nPiya Sharma app install failure dialog on Android 14\nThe new CapraRAT packages also contain a very minimal new class called WebView, which is responsible for maintaining compatibility with older versions of Android via the Android Support Library, which developers can choose to include in a project to enhance compatibility.\nSpyware Activities and C2\nThe app’s MainActivity initiates requests for permissions. The app still runs even if permissions are not granted.\nMainActivity calls the TCHPClient class, which contains the malicious capabilities leveraged by CapraRAT. This class drives several spyware classes and methods, including:\naudioStreamer (aStreamer) \nCallLogLister\nCallReceiver\nContactsLister\nDirLister (file browsing)\ndownloadFile\nkillFile (file deletion)\nkillProcess\nPhotoTaker\nSMSLister \nSMSReceiver\nThese give the spyware fine-grained control over what the user does on the device.\nThe sendData method is responsible for constructing the data collected by other methods and classes and sending it to the C2. The mRun method constructs the socket and sends the data to the C2 server using the variables specified in the Settings class. Each of the current campaign’s APKs use the same C2 server hostname, IP address and TCP port number 18582. The Settings class also shows the same CapraRAT version identifier for each APK, A.D.0.2.\nmRun performs a connectivity check to decide whether to connect to the C2 using the hostname shareboxs[.]net or the hardcoded IP address 173[.]249[.]50[.]243. This IP address has been tied to Transparent Tribe’s CrimsonRAT and AhMyth Android RAT C2 activity since at least 2022. As of this writing, shareboxs[.]net resolves to 173[.]212[.]206[.]227.\nConclusion\nThe updates to the CapraRAT code between the September 2023 campaign and the current campaign are minimal, but suggest the developers are focused on making the tool more reliable and stable. The decision to move to newer versions of the Android OS are logical, and likely align with the group’s sustained targeting of individuals in the Indian government or military space, who are unlikely to use devices running older versions of Android, such as Lollipop which was released 8 years ago.\nThe APK theme updates show the group continues to lean into its social engineering prowess to gain a wider audience of targets who would be interested in the new app lures, such as mobile gamers or weapons enthusiasts.\nTo help prevent compromise by CapraRAT and similar malware, users should always evaluate the permissions requested by an app to determine if they are necessary. For example, an app that only displays TikTok videos does not need the ability to send SMS messages, make calls, or record the screen. In incident response scenarios, treat the related network indicators of compromise as suspect, including the use of port 18582, and search suspect apps for the presence of strings using the unique method names outlined in the Spyware Activities & C2 section of this report.\nIndicators of Compromise\nFiles\nSHA1\nName\n\n\n28bc3b3d8878be4267ee08f20b7816a6ba23623e\nTikTok signed.apk\n\n\nc307f523a1d1aa928fe3db2c6c3ede6902f1084b\nCrazy Game signed.apk\n\n\ndba9f88ba548cebfa389972cddf2bec55b71168b\nSexy Videos signed.apk\n\n\nfff24e9f11651e0bdbee7c5cd1034269f40fc424\nWeapons signed.apk\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Indicators\nDomain/IP\nDescription\n\n\nshareboxs[.]net\nC2 domain\n\n\n173[.]212[.]206[.]227\nResolved C2 IP address, hosts shareboxs.net\n\n\n173[.]249[.]50[.]243\nHardcoded failover C2 IP address",

      "content:encoded": "<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs has discovered a novel malware variant of AcidRain, a wiper that rendered Eutelsat KA-SAT modems inoperative in Ukraine and caused additional disruptions throughout Europe at the onset of the Russian invasion.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The new malware, which we call AcidPour, expands upon AcidRain’s capabilities and destructive potential to now include Linux Unsorted Block Image (UBI) and Device Mapper (DM) logic, better targeting RAID arrays and large storage devices.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Our analysis confirms the connection between AcidRain and AcidPour, effectively connecting it to threat clusters previously publicly attributed to Russian military intelligence. CERT-UA has also attributed this activity to a Sandworm subcluster.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Specific targets of AcidPour have yet to be conclusively verified; however, the discovery coincides with the enduring disruption of multiple Ukrainian telecommunication networks, reportedly offline since March 13th.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The ISP attacks are being publicly claimed by a GRU-operated hacktivist persona via Telegram.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On March 16th, 2024, we identified a suspicious Linux binary uploaded from Ukraine. Initial analysis showed surface similarities with the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">infamous AcidRain wiper</a> used to disable KA-SAT modems across Europe at the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (commonly identified by the ‘Viasat hack’ misnomer). Since our initial finding, no similar samples or variants have been detected or publicly reported until now. This new sample is a confirmed variant we refer to as ‘AcidPour’, a wiper with similar and expanded capabilities.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-theme=\"dark\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is a threat to watch. My concern is elevated because this variant is a more powerful AcidRain variant, covering more hardware and operating system types. <a href=\"https://t.co/h0s6pJGuzv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://t.co/h0s6pJGuzv</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Rob Joyce (@NSA_CSDirector) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSA_CSDirector/status/1770082506856898783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Our technical analysis suggests that AcidPour’s expanded capabilities would enable it to better disable embedded devices including networking, IoT, large storage (RAIDs), and possibly ICS devices running Linux x86 distributions. </p>\n<p>Following our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs/status/1769726024600768959\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial reporting on Twitter</a>, CyberScoop <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/viasat-malware-wiper-acidrain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> a claim from the Ukrainian SSCIP attributing our findings to UAC-0165, clustered as a subgroup under the outdated ‘Sandworm’ threat actor construct. We reported our initial findings to partners on Saturday, followed by the public analysis thread on Twitter. Our analysis is ongoing.</p>\n<h2>AcidRain Context</h2>\n<p>On February 24th, 2022, a cyber attack rendered Eutelsat KA-SAT modems inoperable in Ukraine. Spillover from this attack rendered 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany unable to communicate for remote monitoring or control and reportedly affected vital services across Europe. </p>\n<p>On March 30th, 2022, we identified a wiper component which <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we dubbed ‘AcidRain’</a> as a part of the attack chain that caused this disruption by rendering Surfbeam2 modems inoperable in an attempt to disable vital Ukrainian military communications at the start of the Russian invasion.</p>\n<p>During our original analysis of AcidRain, we assessed with medium-confidence that there are developmental similarities between AcidRain and a <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/vpnfilter-update/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VPNFilter</a> stage 3 destructive plugin named ‘dstr’. In 2018, the FBI and Department of Justice attributed the VPNFilter campaign to the Russian government. </p>\n<p>On May 10th, 2022, the European Union and its Member States <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/05/10/russian-cyber-operations-against-ukraine-declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued an official condemnation</a> of this activity, holding the Russian government responsible. Despite an abundance of wipers and cyber operations against Ukrainian targets in the subsequent months and years, we had not seen any further uses of AcidRain or similar components.</p>\n<h2>Enter AcidPour</h2>\n<p>On March 16th, 2024, we observed a new Linux wiper we are naming ‘AcidPour’. We alerted relevant partners immediately to stem the potential for any additional significant regional impact, followed by public dissemination of technical indicators and early analysis to alert the research community and encourage vigilance and contributions.</p>\n<p>Our initial finding centered on surface similarities with AcidRain, so we placed a large emphasis on ascertaining whether a more conclusive relationship could be established between the two components at a technical level, as well as an understanding of its capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>\n<p>Where AcidRain is a Linux wiper compiled for MIPS architecture for compatibility with the devices targeted, AcidPour is compiled for x86 architecture. Despite both targeting Linux systems, the architecture mismatch somewhat limits our ability to compare the compiled codebases.</p>\n<p>Notably, AcidRain was a hamfisted wiper rather than a specifically tailored solution. It operates by iterating over all possible devices in hardcoded paths, wiping each, before wiping essential directories. Its lack of specificity suggests a lack of familiarity (or time) to adapt to the specifics of the Surfbeam2 targets. However, that also means that AcidRain can serve as a more generic tool able to disable a wider swath of devices reliant on embedded Linux distributions.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20.0%; height: 24px;\"><b>MD5</b></td>\n<td style=\"width: 80.0%; height: 24px;\">1bde1e4ecc8a85cffef1cd4e5379aa44</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20.0%; height: 24px;\"><b>SHA1</b></td>\n<td style=\"width: 80.0%; height: 24px;\">b5de486086eb2579097c141199d13b0838e7b631</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20.0%; height: 24px;\"><b>SHA256</b></td>\n<td style=\"width: 80.0%; height: 24px;\">6a8824048417abe156a16455b8e29170f8347312894fde2aabe644c4995d7728</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20.0%; height: 24px;\"><b>Size</b></td>\n<td style=\"width: 80.0%; height: 24px;\">17,388 bytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20.0%; height: 24px;\"><b>Type</b></td>\n<td style=\"width: 80.0%; height: 24px;\">ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20.0%; height: 24px;\"><b>Filename</b></td>\n<td style=\"width: 80.0%; height: 24px;\">‘tmphluyl8zn’</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 20.0%; height: 24px;\"><b>First Submitted</b></td>\n<td style=\"width: 80.0%; height: 24px;\">2024-03-16 14:42:53 UTC, Ukraine</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The AcidPour variant is an ELF binary compiled for x86 (not MIPS), and while it refers to similar devices, the codebase has been modified and expanded to include additional capabilities.

new binary with a focus on testing the hypothesis that the two are related variants, as well as detailing any net new capabilities.</p>\n<p>Notable similarities include the use of the same reboot mechanism, the exact logic of the recursive directory wiping, and most importantly the use of the same IOCTL-based wiping mechanism used by both AcidRain and the VPNFilter plugin

targeted flash chips via MTD for raw access to flash memory in the form of <code>/dev/mtdXX</code> device paths. This capability is expanded in AcidPour to include <code>/dev/ubiXX</code> paths. UBI is an interface built on top of MTD to act as a <a href=\"http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubifs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wear-leveling and volume management system</a> for flash memory. These devices are common in embedded systems dependent on flash memory like handhelds, IoT, networking, or in some cases ICS devices.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_93443\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93443\" style=\"width: 874px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AcidPour_7.jpg\" alt=\"Block string array of device paths\" width=\"874\" height=\"498\" class=\"size-full wp-image-93443\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AcidPour_7.jpg 874w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AcidPour_7-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AcidPour_7-768x438.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-93443\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Block string array of device paths</figcaption></figure>\n<p>AcidPour also adds logic for handling <code>/dev/dm-XX</code> paths to access mapped devices. The device mapper framework enables logical volume management (<a href=\"https://blog.codefarm.me/2021/11/29/device-mapper-and-linux-lvm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LVM</a>), abstracts physical storage into logical volumes for easier resizing, manipulation, and maintenance. </p>\n<p>These devices act as virtual layers of block devices, enabling features like logical volumes, software RAID, and disk encryption.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Executive Summary\nSentinelLabs has discovered a novel malware variant of AcidRain, a wiper that rendered Eutelsat KA-SAT modems inoperative in Ukraine and caused additional disruptions throughout Europe at the onset of the Russian invasion.\nThe new malware, which we call AcidPour, expands upon AcidRain’s capabilities and destructive potential to now include Linux Unsorted Block Image (UBI) and Device Mapper (DM) logic, better targeting RAID arrays and large storage devices.\nOur analysis confirms the connection between AcidRain and AcidPour, effectively connecting it to threat clusters previously publicly attributed to Russian military intelligence. CERT-UA has also attributed this activity to a Sandworm subcluster.\nSpecific targets of AcidPour have yet to be conclusively verified; however, the discovery coincides with the enduring disruption of multiple Ukrainian telecommunication networks, reportedly offline since March 13th.\nThe ISP attacks are being publicly claimed by a GRU-operated hacktivist persona via Telegram.\nOn March 16th, 2024, we identified a suspicious Linux binary uploaded from Ukraine. Initial analysis showed surface similarities with the infamous AcidRain wiper used to disable KA-SAT modems across Europe at the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (commonly identified by the ‘Viasat hack’ misnomer). Since our initial finding, no similar samples or variants have been detected or publicly reported until now. This new sample is a confirmed variant we refer to as ‘AcidPour’, a wiper with similar and expanded capabilities.\nThis is a threat to watch. My concern is elevated because this variant is a more powerful AcidRain variant, covering more hardware and operating system types. https://t.co/h0s6pJGuzv\n— Rob Joyce (@NSA_CSDirector) March 19, 2024\n\n \nOur technical analysis suggests that AcidPour’s expanded capabilities would enable it to better disable embedded devices including networking, IoT, large storage (RAIDs), and possibly ICS devices running Linux x86 distributions. \nFollowing our initial reporting on Twitter, CyberScoop reported a claim from the Ukrainian SSCIP attributing our findings to UAC-0165, clustered as a subgroup under the outdated ‘Sandworm’ threat actor construct. We reported our initial findings to partners on Saturday, followed by the public analysis thread on Twitter. Our analysis is ongoing.\nAcidRain Context\nOn February 24th, 2022, a cyber attack rendered Eutelsat KA-SAT modems inoperable in Ukraine. Spillover from this attack rendered 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany unable to communicate for remote monitoring or control and reportedly affected vital services across Europe. \nOn March 30th, 2022, we identified a wiper component which we dubbed ‘AcidRain’ as a part of the attack chain that caused this disruption by rendering Surfbeam2 modems inoperable in an attempt to disable vital Ukrainian military communications at the start of the Russian invasion.\nDuring our original analysis of AcidRain, we assessed with medium-confidence that there are developmental similarities between AcidRain and a VPNFilter stage 3 destructive plugin named ‘dstr’. In 2018, the FBI and Department of Justice attributed the VPNFilter campaign to the Russian government. \nOn May 10th, 2022, the European Union and its Member States issued an official condemnation of this activity, holding the Russian government responsible. Despite an abundance of wipers and cyber operations against Ukrainian targets in the subsequent months and years, we had not seen any further uses of AcidRain or similar components.\nEnter AcidPour\nOn March 16th, 2024, we observed a new Linux wiper we are naming ‘AcidPour’. We alerted relevant partners immediately to stem the potential for any additional significant regional impact, followed by public dissemination of technical indicators and early analysis to alert the research community and encourage vigilance and contributions.\nOur initial finding centered on surface similarities with AcidRain, so we placed a large emphasis on ascertaining whether a more conclusive relationship could be established between the two components at a technical level, as well as an understanding of its capabilities.\nTechnical Analysis\nWhere AcidRain is a Linux wiper compiled for MIPS architecture for compatibility with the devices targeted, AcidPour is compiled for x86 architecture. Despite both targeting Linux systems, the architecture mismatch somewhat limits our ability to compare the compiled codebases.\nNotably, AcidRain was a hamfisted wiper rather than a specifically tailored solution. It operates by iterating over all possible devices in hardcoded paths, wiping each, before wiping essential directories. Its lack of specificity suggests a lack of familiarity (or time) to adapt to the specifics of the Surfbeam2 targets. However, that also means that AcidRain can serve as a more generic tool able to disable a wider swath of devices reliant on embedded Linux distributions.\nMD5\n1bde1e4ecc8a85cffef1cd4e5379aa44\n\n\nSHA1\nb5de486086eb2579097c141199d13b0838e7b631\n\n\nSHA256\n6a8824048417abe156a16455b8e29170f8347312894fde2aabe644c4995d7728\n\n\nSize\n17,388 bytes\n\n\nType\nELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped\n\n\nFilename\n‘tmphluyl8zn’\n\n\nFirst Submitted\n2024-03-16 14:42:53 UTC, Ukraine\n\n\n\nThe AcidPour variant is an ELF binary compiled for x86 (not MIPS), and while it refers to similar devices, the codebase has been modified and expanded to include additional capabilities. Our best automated attempts to compare across different architectures only yields a low confidence < 30% similarity.\nBinDiff output comparing AcidRain (MIPS) and AcidPour (x86)\nWe took that as a base measurement and proceeded to conduct a deep-dive analysis of the new binary with a focus on testing the hypothesis that the two are related variants, as well as detailing any net new capabilities.\nNotable similarities include the use of the same reboot mechanism, the exact logic of the recursive directory wiping, and most importantly the use of the same IOCTL-based wiping mechanism used by both AcidRain and the VPNFilter plugin ‘dstr’.\nShared Reboot Mechanism\n\nRecursive Directory Processing\n\nWiping Mechanisms\nAt the time of discovery, we noted the similarities between AcidRain’s IOCTLs-based device-wiping mechanism and the VPNFilter plugin ‘dstr’, pictured below:\n\nAcidPour relies on the same device wiping mechanism:\nAcidPour’s IOCTL-based wiping mechanism\nAcidPour’s Net New Functionality\nAcidPour expands upon AcidRain’s targeted linux devices to include Unsorted Block Image (UBI) and Device Mapper (DM) logic.\nAcidRain’s supported devices:\n/dev/sd*\nA generic block device\n\n\n/dev/mtdblock*\nFlash memory (common in routers and IoT devices)\n\n\n/dev/block/mtdblock*\nAnother potential way of accessing flash memory\n\n\n/dev/mtd*\nThe device file for flash memory that supports fileops\n\n\n/dev/mmcblk*\nFor SD/MMC cards\n\n\n/dev/block/mmcblk*\nAnother potential way of accessing SD/MMC cards\n\n\n/dev/loop*\nVirtual block devices\n\n\n\nAcidRain targeted flash chips via MTD for raw access to flash memory in the form of /dev/mtdXX device paths. This capability is expanded in AcidPour to include /dev/ubiXX paths. UBI is an interface built on top of MTD to act as a wear-leveling and volume management system for flash memory. These devices are common in embedded systems dependent on flash memory like handhelds, IoT, networking, or in some cases ICS devices.\nBlock string array of device paths\nAcidPour also adds logic for handling /dev/dm-XX paths to access mapped devices. The device mapper framework enables logical volume management (LVM), abstracts physical storage into logical volumes for easier resizing, manipulation, and maintenance. \nThese devices act as virtual layers of block devices, enabling features like logical volumes, software RAID, and disk encryption. This would put devices like Storage Area Networks (SANs), Network Attached Storage (NASes), and dedicated RAID arrays in scope for AcidPour’s effects.\nAll Local, No imports\nOne of the most interesting aspects of AcidPour is its coding style, reminiscent of the pragmatic CaddyWiper broadly utilized against Ukrainian targets alongside notable malware like Industroyer 2. \nAcidPour is programmed in C without relying on statically-compiled libraries or imports. Most functionality is implemented via direct syscalls, many called through the use of inline assembly and opcodes.\nExample of a direct syscall implementation\nThis forces some unusual seemingly-archaic approaches to simple operations like storing and modifying format strings for device paths as needed in the course of their operations.\n\nSelf-Delete\nPerhaps as a response to the discovery of AcidRain, this new version now kicks off with a self-delete function. It maps the original file into memory, then overwrites it with a sequence of bytes ranging from 0-255 followed by a polite Ok.\nAcidPour overwrites itself on disk at the beginning of its execution\nAlternate Device Wiping Mechanism\nAt the time of our discovery of AcidRain, there was some confusion about the involvement of a wiper in taking down the Surfbeam2 modems. As we reverse engineered the malware, we found a second wiping mechanism that didn’t rely on IOCTLs. This alternate mechanism filled a buffer with the highest byte value (0xFFFFFFFF) and proceeded to decrement by 1, overwriting its target with the result. That allowed us to connect AcidRain’s expected output with dumps of the affected devices.\nViasat incident\nI managed to dump the flash of two Surfbeam2 modems: 'attacked1.bin' belongs to a targeted modem during the attack, 'fw_fixed.bin' is a clean one.\nA destructive attack. pic.twitter.com/0QuTrLFR2A\n— reversemode (@reversemode) March 31, 2022\n\n \nWith this crucial detail in mind, we were curious as to whether AcidPour implements an analogous alternate wiping mechanism.\n\nDepending on the device type, a different wiping mechanism is engaged, overwriting the device repeatedly with the contents of a 256kb buffer.

The activities we observed closely resemble and partially overlap with those previously reported by <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2023-1205.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Recorded Future</a> and <a href=\"https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/406961197_3573768156197610_1503341237955279091_n.pdf?_nc_cat=105&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=b8d81d&amp;_nc_ohc=BIsHvhRBy-wAX_oUOUq&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-fra3-1.xx&amp;oh=00_AfDlKig7uDFr-LwWeLt4vOJrrfMYUY0Ry1pmUlnuGFJTZA&amp;oe=65CDB212\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meta</a>, indicating the persistent nature of Doppelgänger.</p>\n<p>We observed Doppelgänger orchestrating the operation of a large coordinated network of X (formerly known as Twitter) accounts. These accounts propagate content from third-party websites whose content aligns with Doppelgänger propaganda goals, as well as from sites that Doppelgänger itself has created.</p>\n<p>The majority of the X accounts we discovered as part of our investigation had not been deactivated at the time of writing. In an effort to maximize visibility and audience engagement, these accounts participate in coordinated activities, such as regularly posting and reposting content from highly popular profiles, as well as engaging with posts from other suspected Doppelgänger-managed accounts.</p>\n<p>The posts from these accounts contain links that redirect visitors through two stages to the destination articles intended for consumption. These stages implement obfuscation and tracking techniques. Coupled with the carefully constructed infrastructure management practices we observed Doppelgänger implementing, this underscores the network’s determination to operate without interruptions while effectively tracking the performance of its influence operations.</p>\n<h2>Redirection Stages</h2>\n<p>The first-stage websites, which Doppelgänger distributes on X, use thumbnail images hosted at <code>telegra[.]ph</code> to obfuscate the website thumbnails and redirect to second-stage sites.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_92029\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92029\" style=\"width: 849px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_6.jpg\" alt=\"First-stage website\" width=\"849\" height=\"444\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92029\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_6.jpg 849w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_6-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_6-768x402.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-92029\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">First-stage website</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The second-stage websites contain text unrelated to the campaign and execute a JavaScript code obfuscated using Base64-encoding.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_92063\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92063\" style=\"width: 816px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_12.jpg\" alt=\"Second-stage website\" width=\"816\" height=\"600\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92063\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_12.jpg 816w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_12-300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_12-768x565.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-92063\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Second-stage website</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The JavaScript code samples we analyzed issue a request to <code>ggspace[.]space</code> (reported as part of previous Doppelgaenger campaigns) or <code>sdgqaef[.]site</code>.

Among these sites, there are domains and websites impersonating third-party news outlets, which includes mimicking their design, structure, and domain names, such as <code>welt[.]pm</code> (inauthentic) vs. <code>welt[.]de</code> (authentic) and <code>faz[.]ltd</code> (inauthentic) vs. <code>faz[.]net</code> (authentic). We assess that the rest of the websites we observed have been created by Doppelgänger with original design and structure and no indications of impersonating established news platforms.</p>\n<p>In most cases, we observed consistent and regular publishing of new content, with only occasional idle periods lasting a few days at most. Some of the content consists of a blend of materials sourced from other websites and translated into the languages of the targeted audiences.</p>\n<p>A closer look at the custom-built websites indicates that Doppelgänger has been making a fast-paced effort to bring its websites online and start distributing content. For example, some sites include template text or exhibit errors in search functionalities. Furthermore, nearly all of these websites lack social media presence. They display icons of social media platforms that link to the domains of these platforms rather than specific profiles.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_92054\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92054\" style=\"width: 1214px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_18.jpg\" alt=\"Template text (emphasis added)\" width=\"1214\" height=\"184\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92054\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_18.jpg 1214w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_18-300x45.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_18-1024x155.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Doppel_18-768x116.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1214px) 100vw, 1214px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-92054\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Template text (emphasis added)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Many of the custom-built websites have been built and are managed using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress</a> content management system.

The domains of these websites typically have short lifespans, lasting only several days at a time and recurring multiple times over a few years. We observe that Doppelgänger activates the domains for brief periods during its campaigns before deactivating them again.</p>\n<p>The domains of the first-stage websites have a diverse range of top-level domains (TLDs), including generic TLDs such as <code>.buzz</code>, <code>.art</code>, <code>.store</code>, <code>.site</code>, and <code>.online</code>, as well as country code TLDs like <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.br</code>. The domains’ format suggests an automated generation approach involving the creation of subdomains and numerical suffixes, for example, <code>pcrrjx.kredit-money-fun169[.]buzz</code> and <code>yzrhhk.kredit-money-fun202[.]buzz</code>.</p>\n<p>This strategy, combined with the frequent rotation between hosting providers and the cyclical nature of the domains, indicates an effort by Doppelgänger to evade detection and tracking of its first-stage infrastructure, which is exposed on social media platforms and therefore more likely to be subjected to scrutiny. Doppelgänger does not apply the same domain naming convention to second-stage websites, which are not directly exposed on social media platforms.</p>\n<p>Playing a central role in Doppelgänger’s campaigns, <code>ggspace[.]space</code> and <code>sdgqaef[.]site</code> are responsible for both redirection and presumably monitoring campaign performance. They are hosted behind a Cloud-based reverse proxy infrastructure, likely implemented as a security measure to obfuscate their true hosting locations. In contrast to the first-stage and second-stage domains, the active periods of these domains typically span several months during Doppelgänger’s campaigns.</p>\n<p>Many of the servers hosting the destination websites are managed using cPanel, and some implement geofencing, which restricts traffic to IP addresses from targeted countries. This practice is likely intended to minimize exposure of their infrastructure and content to scrutiny and monitoring by researchers or authorities outside those regions, reducing the likelihood of detection and investigation into Doppelgänger’s activities.</p>\n<p>The domains of the majority of these websites were first registered in the first quarter of 2023 and some as early as mid-2022, remaining active as of the time of writing. A smaller subset of domains, such as <code>derglaube[.]com</code>, which we assess with high confidence as being managed by Doppelgänger at this time, have been active for nearly 10 years, with intermittent periods of inactivity lasting a few years at most.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Doppelgänger represents an active instrument of information warfare, characterized by strategic use of propaganda and disinformation to influence public opinion. The campaign targeting Germany we discussed in this post serves as a compelling example of the <a href=\"https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20240212_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_PORTAL-KOMBAT-NETWORK_ENG_VF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">persistent</a> and continually evolving nature of Russia-aligned influence operations, which exploit social media and current topics of geopolitical and socio-economic significance to shape perceptions.</p>\n<p>We anticipate that Doppelgänger&#8217;s activities, targeting not only Germany but also other Western countries, will persist and evolve, particularly in light of the major elections scheduled across the EU and the USA in the coming years. We expect Doppelgänger to continue innovating its infrastructure and obfuscation tactics to make its activities more difficult to detect and disrupt.</p>\n<p>We emphasize that countering influence operations requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach, involving enhancing public awareness and media literacy to identify and resist manipulation, alongside prompt and effective actions by social media platforms and infrastructure operators to limit the spread of propaganda and disinformation online.</p>\n<p>SentinelLabs continues to monitor Doppelgänger activities and remains committed to timely reporting on its operations to improve public awareness of this threat and mitigate its impact.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<p>Due to the extensive volume of observed indicators, we present here only a selection, including indicators from parallel campaigns targeting France alongside those targeting German audiences.</p>\n<h3>Domains</h3>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Executive Summary\nSentinelLabs and ClearSky Cyber Security have been tracking the activities of a suspected Russia-aligned influence operation network named Doppelgänger.\nWe observed Doppelgänger intensively targeting German audiences, coinciding with recent reports from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Der Spiegel.\nThe network spreads propaganda and disinformation through news articles focused on current socio-economic and geopolitical topics relevant to the general population.\nDoppelgänger disseminates content criticizing the ruling government coalition and its support for Ukraine, likely aiming to influence public opinion before the upcoming elections in Germany.\nDoppelgänger leverages a substantial network of X accounts, actively participating in coordinated activities to enhance visibility and engage audiences.\nOverview\nSentinelLabs and ClearSky Cyber Security have been tracking a propaganda and disinformation campaign since late November 2023, highly likely orchestrated by Doppelgänger, a suspected Russia-aligned influence operation network known for its persistent and aggressive tactics. Initially focusing on disseminating anti-Ukraine content following the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, Doppelgänger has since broadened its scope, targeting audiences in the US, Israel, Germany, and France.\nWe observed a significant emphasis by Doppelgänger on targeting German audiences. The network’s activities are characterized by consistent efforts to disseminate propaganda and disinformation content, particularly by exploiting current topics of geopolitical and socio-economic significance among the population. The majority of the content seizes every opportunity to criticize the ruling government coalition and its support for Ukraine.\nWith Doppelgänger activities intensifying in times of frequent political shifts in Germany, we suspect that the network’s goal is to erode support for the coalition in light of upcoming European Parliament, municipal, and federal state elections, culminating in federal government elections scheduled for 2025.\nWhile we were documenting the Doppelgänger campaign, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the prominent German media outlet Der Spiegel reported on overlapping activities, highlighting a growing concern about election interference.\nIn this post, we supplement existing reporting by providing additional technical indicators and insights into Doppelgänger’s tactics and disseminated content, with the ultimate goal of further heightening public awareness of this threat.\nThis report focuses on Doppelgänger activities targeting German audiences; a complementary report by Clearsky Cyber Security delves into the network’s targeting of Israel, the United States, and Ukraine. The activities we observed closely resemble and partially overlap with those previously reported by Recorded Future and Meta, indicating the persistent nature of Doppelgänger.\nWe observed Doppelgänger orchestrating the operation of a large coordinated network of X (formerly known as Twitter) accounts. These accounts propagate content from third-party websites whose content aligns with Doppelgänger propaganda goals, as well as from sites that Doppelgänger itself has created.\nThe majority of the X accounts we discovered as part of our investigation had not been deactivated at the time of writing. In an effort to maximize visibility and audience engagement, these accounts participate in coordinated activities, such as regularly posting and reposting content from highly popular profiles, as well as engaging with posts from other suspected Doppelgänger-managed accounts.\nThe posts from these accounts contain links that redirect visitors through two stages to the destination articles intended for consumption. These stages implement obfuscation and tracking techniques. Coupled with the carefully constructed infrastructure management practices we observed Doppelgänger implementing, this underscores the network’s determination to operate without interruptions while effectively tracking the performance of its influence operations.\nRedirection Stages\nThe first-stage websites, which Doppelgänger distributes on X, use thumbnail images hosted at telegra[.]ph to obfuscate the website thumbnails and redirect to second-stage sites.\nFirst-stage website\nThe second-stage websites contain text unrelated to the campaign and execute a JavaScript code obfuscated using Base64-encoding.\nSecond-stage website\nThe JavaScript code samples we analyzed issue a request to ggspace[.]space (reported as part of previous Doppelgaenger campaigns) or sdgqaef[.]site. The request includes tracking information, which is likely a campaign identifier. These are in the format of [country]-[day]-[month]_[domain], where [domain] refers to the domain hosting the destination article (DE-02-01_deintelligenz for an article hosted at deintelligenz[.]com). The IOC table at the end of this post lists some of the campaign identifiers we observed.\nSecond-stage website: Deobfuscated JavaScript code\nIn addition, the JavaScript code executed by second-stage websites dynamically loads another JavaScript code provided by ggspace[.]space or sdgqaef[.]site, which implements logic for generating web content that redirects to a destination article.\n\nJavaScript code from sdgqaef[.]site\nsdgqaef[.]site and ggspace[.]space host at the /admin URL path a login page, which has been assessed to be of the Keitaro Tracking System. Doppelgaenger possibly uses Keitaro to track the effectiveness of its campaigns.\nLogin page hosted at sdgqaef[.]site\nSocial Media Activities\nProbably in an attempt to increase their visibility, some of the suspected Doppelgänger-managed X accounts we identified regularly post content, which does not necessarily contain first-stage websites, whereas others remain idle for relatively long time periods.\n\nAn active and idle suspected Doppelgänger account\nWe observed accounts posting content linking to first-stage sites in multiple languages of the targeted audiences. Further, the Doppelgänger’s account network is probably attempting to increase the engagement metrics of posts that link to first-stage websites in a targeted manner through reposts and views. This becomes evident when these metrics are compared with the metrics of posts by the same accounts that do not link to first-stage websites.\nMulti-language posts tailored to the targeted audiences\nEngagement metric discrepancies\nWe identified multiple clusters of suspected Doppelgänger-managed accounts which have joined the X platform within the same month. We observed a significant level of coordination in the activities of the accounts within the same cluster, suggesting centralized control. This includes reposting of the same content at almost the same time, typically that of highly popular profiles. In addition, engagement metrics of posts that link to first-stage sites by suspected Doppelgänger accounts within the same cluster often have very similar engagement metrics.\n\nCoordinated activities\nEngagement metric similarities\nOur analysis of the engagement metrics for almost all the accounts we identified revealed a range of reposts between 700 and 2000, with a median value of 883, and a range of views between 613 and 14000, with a median value of 5000.\nPropaganda and Disinformation Content\nDoppelgänger has been very active in creating websites that host articles for consumption by targeted audiences through the previously described multi-stage approach. Among these sites, there are domains and websites impersonating third-party news outlets, which includes mimicking their design, structure, and domain names, such as welt[.]pm (inauthentic) vs. welt[.]de (authentic) and faz[.]ltd (inauthentic) vs. faz[.]net (authentic). We assess that the rest of the websites we observed have been created by Doppelgänger with original design and structure and no indications of impersonating established news platforms.\nIn most cases, we observed consistent and regular publishing of new content, with only occasional idle periods lasting a few days at most. Some of the content consists of a blend of materials sourced from other websites and translated into the languages of the targeted audiences.\nA closer look at the custom-built websites indicates that Doppelgänger has been making a fast-paced effort to bring its websites online and start distributing content. For example, some sites include template text or exhibit errors in search functionalities. Furthermore, nearly all of these websites lack social media presence. They display icons of social media platforms that link to the domains of these platforms rather than specific profiles.\nTemplate text (emphasis added)\nMany of the custom-built websites have been built and are managed using the WordPress content management system. We observed that some websites display status messages in Russian when users perform content searches and the activity fails with an error, indicating the use of Russian-language WordPress components.\nWordPress status message translates to “Search for”\nThe majority of the articles Doppelgänger distributes have a strong anti-government narrative, especially in regard to the government’s support of Ukraine. The article snippets we present below are machine-translated from German into English.\nAn article at arbeitspause[.]org discusses a recent series of strikes by workers in the German public transport demanding better wages and better working conditions. The challenges relating to the state of workers in this sector, such as rising living costs due to inflation and shortage of workers, are a pressing concern in Germany that captures the attention of the broader population.\nArticle snippet from arbeitspause[.]org, referencing Scholz, the German chancellor (emphasis added)\nOn a similar note, another article at arbeitspause[.]org focuses on the recent strikes by German farmers, which involved the blockade of major roads and were motivated by rising living costs and the government’s plan to phase out agricultural subsidies. Overlapping at times with the strikes in the public transport sectors, the farmers’ strikes have been disrupting mobility and therefore garnered the attention of the population and mass media. Doppelgänger has attempted to capitalize on the momentum by criticizing the government’s plan regarding agricultural subsidies, drawing a connection to the government’s support for Ukraine.\nArticle snippet from arbeitspause[.]org\nAn article at derglaube[.]com focuses on the German immigration policy, which, according to some polls, ranks among the top issues for voters in Germany. In addition, the media frequently covers topics relating to the government’s allocation of funds for immigration-related programs and services. Consistent with typical Doppelgänger practices, the influence operation network uses this opportunity to cast the government in a negative light and introduce its support for Ukraine into the narrative.\nArticle snippet from derglaube[.]com (original emphasis)\nArticle snippet from derglaube[.]com (emphasis added)\nIn an attempt to blend political-oriented propaganda or disinformation among other topics, some websites host articles covering broader subjects such as health, sports, and culture. We observed attempts to introduce propaganda even in such articles. For example, an article hosted at miastagebuch[.]com initially discusses headaches from a medical perspective only to later indicate the German government as one of the major causes of headaches.\nAnti-government statements in a health-themed article (emphasis added)\nWe emphasize that Doppelgänger also targets Germany through articles published by third-party outlets, such as telepolis[.]de, freiewelt[.]net, overton-magazin[.]de, and deutschlandkurier[.]de.\nThe articles from these outlets that Doppelgänger disseminates focus on both domestic and international topics, some with a strong anti-Western narrative. For instance, an article from overton-magazin[.]de portrays the West as profiteering from the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, while depicting Ukraine as a plaything of Western global players (cit.).\nArticle snippet from overton-magazin[.]de (emphasis added)\nAdditionally, an article from osthessen-news[.]de highlights factors such as the Ukraine war and inflation as contributors to economic challenges in Germany, prompting medium-sized companies to consider restructuring due to escalating costs. Issues concerning small- and mid-sized companies are particularly relevant to the broader German audience, given their significant contribution to the country’s overall economy.\nArticle snippet from osthessen-news[.]de\nInfrastructure\nThe Doppelgänger infrastructure can be structured into four parts subject to different infrastructure management and control practices, with each part designated to hosting the different entities involved in disseminating content for consumption by targeted audiences: the first-stage and second-stage redirection websites, the servers likely used for monitoring campaign performance (ggspace[.]space and sdgqaef[.]site), and the destination websites.\nThe first-stage and second-stage websites often shift between a variety of hosting providers, such as Hostinger, Global Internet Solutions, and Digital Ocean. The domains of these websites typically have short lifespans, lasting only several days at a time and recurring multiple times over a few years. We observe that Doppelgänger activates the domains for brief periods during its campaigns before deactivating them again.\nThe domains of the first-stage websites have a diverse range of top-level domains (TLDs), including generic TLDs such as .buzz, .art, .store, .site, and .online, as well as country code TLDs like .co.uk and .br. The domains’ format suggests an automated generation approach involving the creation of subdomains and numerical suffixes, for example, pcrrjx.kredit-money-fun169[.]buzz and yzrhhk.kredit-money-fun202[.]buzz.\nThis strategy, combined with the frequent rotation between hosting providers and the cyclical nature of the domains, indicates an effort by Doppelgänger to evade detection and tracking of its first-stage infrastructure, which is exposed on social media platforms and therefore more likely to be subjected to scrutiny. Doppelgänger does not apply the same domain naming convention to second-stage websites, which are not directly exposed on social media platforms.\nPlaying a central role in Doppelgänger’s campaigns, ggspace[.]space and sdgqaef[.]site are responsible for both redirection and presumably monitoring campaign performance. They are hosted behind a Cloud-based reverse proxy infrastructure, likely implemented as a security measure to obfuscate their true hosting locations. In contrast to the first-stage and second-stage domains, the active periods of these domains typically span several months during Doppelgänger’s campaigns.\nMany of the servers hosting the destination websites are managed using cPanel, and some implement geofencing, which restricts traffic to IP addresses from targeted countries. This practice is likely intended to minimize exposure of their infrastructure and content to scrutiny and monitoring by researchers or authorities outside those regions, reducing the likelihood of detection and investigation into Doppelgänger’s activities.\nThe domains of the majority of these websites were first registered in the first quarter of 2023 and some as early as mid-2022, remaining active as of the time of writing. A smaller subset of domains, such as derglaube[.]com, which we assess with high confidence as being managed by Doppelgänger at this time, have been active for nearly 10 years, with intermittent periods of inactivity lasting a few years at most.\nConclusions\nDoppelgänger represents an active instrument of information warfare, characterized by strategic use of propaganda and disinformation to influence public opinion. The campaign targeting Germany we discussed in this post serves as a compelling example of the persistent and continually evolving nature of Russia-aligned influence operations, which exploit social media and current topics of geopolitical and socio-economic significance to shape perceptions.\nWe anticipate that Doppelgänger’s activities, targeting not only Germany but also other Western countries, will persist and evolve, particularly in light of the major elections scheduled across the EU and the USA in the coming years. We expect Doppelgänger to continue innovating its infrastructure and obfuscation tactics to make its activities more difficult to detect and disrupt.\nWe emphasize that countering influence operations requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach, involving enhancing public awareness and media literacy to identify and resist manipulation, alongside prompt and effective actions by social media platforms and infrastructure operators to limit the spread of propaganda and disinformation online.\nSentinelLabs continues to monitor Doppelgänger activities and remains committed to timely reporting on its operations to improve public awareness of this threat and mitigate its impact.\nIndicators of Compromise\nDue to the extensive volume of observed indicators, we present here only a selection, including indicators from parallel campaigns targeting France alongside those targeting German audiences.\nDomains\nValue\nNote\n\n\n09474w.reyt-cre-ad34[.]buzz\nFirst-stage

It is not known who pilfered the information nor their motives, but this leak provides a first-of-its-kind look at the internal operations of a state-affiliated hacking contractor. The authenticity of the documents is still undecided. While the leak’s contents do confirm public threat intelligence, efforts to corroborate further the documents are on-going.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The leak provides some of the most concrete details seen publicly to date, revealing the maturing nature of China’s cyber espionage ecosystem. It shows explicitly how government targeting requirements drive a competitive marketplace of independent contractor hackers-for-hire.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">I-Soon–whose employees complain about low pay and gamble over mahjong in the office–appears to be responsible for the compromise of at least 14 governments, pro-democracy organizations in Hong Kong, universities, and NATO. The leaked documents align with previous threat intel on several named threat groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Victim data and targeting lists, as well as names of the clients who requested them, show a company who competes for low-value hacking contracts from many government agencies. The finding indicates that historical targeting information from Advanced Persistent Threats thought to be PRC contractors does not provide strong guidance on future targets.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Machine translation enabled the rapid consumption of leaked data. These tools broadened the initial analysis of the information beyond seasoned China experts with specialized language skills and technical knowledge. This has enabled many more analysts to scan the leaked information and quickly extract and socialize findings. As researchers dig into the voluminous information, domain expertise will be required to understand the complex relationships and implicit patterns between the relevant organizations, companies, and individuals.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Executive Summary\nI-Soon (上海安洵), a company that contracts for many PRC agencies–including the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, and People’s Liberation Army–was subject to a data leak over the weekend of Feb 16th. It is not known who pilfered the information nor their motives, but this leak provides a first-of-its-kind look at the internal operations of a state-affiliated hacking contractor. The authenticity of the documents is still undecided. While the leak’s contents do confirm public threat intelligence, efforts to corroborate further the documents are on-going.\nThe leak provides some of the most concrete details seen publicly to date, revealing the maturing nature of China’s cyber espionage ecosystem. It shows explicitly how government targeting requirements drive a competitive marketplace of independent contractor hackers-for-hire.\nI-Soon–whose employees complain about low pay and gamble over mahjong in the office–appears to be responsible for the compromise of at least 14 governments, pro-democracy organizations in Hong Kong, universities, and NATO. The leaked documents align with previous threat intel on several named threat groups.\nVictim data and targeting lists, as well as names of the clients who requested them, show a company who competes for low-value hacking contracts from many government agencies. The finding indicates that historical targeting information from Advanced Persistent Threats thought to be PRC contractors does not provide strong guidance on future targets.\nMachine translation enabled the rapid consumption of leaked data. These tools broadened the initial analysis of the information beyond seasoned China experts with specialized language skills and technical knowledge. This has enabled many more analysts to scan the leaked information and quickly extract and socialize findings. As researchers dig into the voluminous information, domain expertise will be required to understand the complex relationships and implicit patterns between the relevant organizations, companies, and individuals. One upshot is that geographically-specialized analysis will continue to provide distinct value, but the barrier to entry is much lower.\nInitial Observations\nAt 10:19 pm on January 15th, someone, somewhere, registered the email address I-SOON@proton.me.

      "content:encoded": "<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SNS Sender is a script that enables bulk SMS spamming using AWS SNS, aka Smishing, a previously unseen technique in the context of cloud attack tools.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The script author is currently known by the alias <code>ARDUINO_DAS</code> and is prolific in the phish kit scene.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The script requires valid AWS SNS credentials compromised from an environment not subject to the SNS sandbox restrictions.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We identified links between this actor and numerous phishing kits used to target victims’ personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card details.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The smishing scams often take the guise of a message from the United States Postal Service (USPS) regarding a missed package delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>A common thread between businesses and threat actors is that both are moving workloads previously handled by traditional web servers to the cloud. SentinelLabs has identified one example of this in the form of SNS Sender, a Python script that uses AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send bulk SMS messages for the purpose of spamming phishing links, <em>aka</em> Smishing.</p>\n<p>SNS Sender is the first script we encountered using AWS SNS to send spam texts. The script requires access to an AWS account in which the service was already provisioned, configured, and enabled. By default, AWS accounts are subject to restrictions through a feature called the SNS sandbox. These restrictions can be removed if the customer spends $1 and provides a viable use case to AWS support, who manually review such requests. While other tools like <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dissecting-alienfox-the-cloud-spammers-swiss-army-knife/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AlienFox</a> have used business to customer (B2C) communications platforms such as Twilio to conduct SMS spamming attacks, we are unaware of existing research that details tools abusing AWS SNS to conduct such attacks.</p>\n<p>We identified links between the actor behind this tool and many phishing kits used to target victims’ personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card details under the guise of a message from the United States Postal Service (USPS) regarding a missed package delivery. We believe this actor is using cloud services to send bulk SMS phishing messages, though they may still be testing the tool based on some questionable programming choices.</p>\n<h2>Script Analysis</h2>\n<p>SNS Sender is a script that enables bulk SMS spamming using AWS SNS. The script requires a list of phishing links named <code>links.txt</code> in its working directory. SNS Sender also takes several arguments that are entered as input:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">A text file containing a list of AWS access keys, secrets, and region delimited by a colon</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">A text file containing a list of phone numbers to target</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">A sender ID, similar to a display name for a message</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The message content</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_91748\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91748\" style=\"width: 823px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91748\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNSSender_3.jpg\" alt=\"SNS Sender inputs and outputs\" width=\"823\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNSSender_3.jpg 823w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNSSender_3-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNSSender_3-768x281.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-91748\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SNS Sender inputs and outputs</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The <code>send_sns_message</code> function sets up the AWS boto3 client–an interface between the Python script and the AWS SNS backend–to send the SMS messages. The <code>boto3</code> client variables are obtained through the arguments that the script user provided.</p>\n<p>The sender ID variable is an interesting inclusion. According to AWS <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/channels-sms-awssupport-sender-id.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a>, this variable is optional and is supported in some countries. In the United States, carriers do not support sender IDs, whereas in India, they are mandatory. The inclusion of a sender ID contrasts with the actor’s association with USPS-themed phishing kits targeting Americans. The oversight may indicate the actor is not familiar with this exception and likely resides in a country where the sender ID is commonplace.</p>\n<p>SNS Sender establishes a <code>while</code> loop that iterates through the list of AWS credentials and regions. The script replaces any occurrences of the string <code>linkas</code> in the message content variable with a URL from the <code>links.txt</code> file, which weaponizes the message as a phishing SMS. The link is selected randomly using the Python <code>random</code> library’s <code>choice</code> method.</p>\n<p>The script tracks how many AWS access key pairs have been accessed through the <code>a</code> variable and how many phone numbers have been used through the <code>y</code> variable, which are initialized as 0 and incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Each message is sent using the credentials from one line from the AWS access key pair list, and the tracking ensures that the next line is accessed for the subsequent message.</p>\n<p>To run at scale, the list would need to be incredibly long, and likely repeat access key &amp; secret pairs, making this a coding method with questionable efficacy.</p>\n<h2>Phishing Kits</h2>\n<p>When investigating the handle <code>ARDUINO_DAS</code>, we identified more than 150 phishing kit files containing references to the actor. More than half of the kits are USPS-themed. The assets in these archives are similar in name to the URIs present in several recent Smishing campaigns using a missed package delivery lure. We believe that the actor abandoned the <code>ARDUINO_DAS</code> handle in 2023 after accusations that the actor scammed buyers. However, some recently circulated phishing kits still reference this handle, which may make it an artifact of actors using the phishing kit.</p>\n<p>Due to the link between <code>ARDUINO_DAS</code> and USPS phishing, we explored several active campaigns circulating through early January 2024, hosted on <code>hxxps://usps[.]mytrackingh[.]top</code> and <code>hxxps://u-sipsl[.]cc</code>. Both sites host a USPS-themed phishing site with a flow like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Landing Page: Explains to the visitor that their USPS package is unable to be delivered.

Other researchers have <a href=\"https://permiso.io/blog/s/smishing-attack-on-aws-sms-new-phone-who-dis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">detailed</a> which APIs have been used during in-the-wild AWS SNS abuse attacks, as well as <a href=\"https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/following-attackers-trail-in-aws-methodology-findings-in-the-wild/#most-common-enumeration-techniques\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enumeration</a> routes actors may take to verify a targeted environment’s SNS capabilities. SNS Sender provides a glimpse into how actors conduct these attacks.</p>\n<p>SNS Sender represents a more narrow approach that relies on the actor having access to a properly configured AWS SNS tenant. Using AWS presents a challenge for this actor: AWS does not allow SMS notifications via SNS by default. For this feature to work, the tenant needs to be removed from the SNS sandbox environment. This is an update from previous <a href=\"https://permiso.io/blog/s/smishing-attack-on-aws-sms-new-phone-who-dis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research</a> where AWS automatically allowed accounts to send to 10 destination numbers while an account is in the SNS sandbox.</p>\n<p>Organizations using AWS SNS can protect themselves by reviewing the SNS <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a> for the latest information. AWS has shared <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox-moving-to-production.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guidance</a> for organizations to learn more about the SNS sandbox and how to change sending limits. Identity and Access Management (IAM) administrators should review identity best <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/security-iam.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">practices</a> to optimize their organization’s security posture.</p>\n<p>Desire for recognition presents operational security challenges for actors developing tools for the opportunistic cloud hacking scene. The actor including their handle in the script is ubiquitous among cloud hack tools, enabling researchers to form a point of attribution even when <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/exploring-fbot-python-based-malware-targeting-cloud-and-payment-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delineating</a> the tool families becomes challenging due to extensive overlap.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<p>8fd501d7af71afee3e692a6880284616522d709e &#8211; sns_sender.py, SNS Sender</p>\n<h3>Phishing

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Executive Summary\nSNS Sender is a script that enables bulk SMS spamming using AWS SNS, aka Smishing, a previously unseen technique in the context of cloud attack tools.\nThe script author is currently known by the alias ARDUINO_DAS and is prolific in the phish kit scene.\nThe script requires valid AWS SNS credentials compromised from an environment not subject to the SNS sandbox restrictions.\nWe identified links between this actor and numerous phishing kits used to target victims’ personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card details.\nThe smishing scams often take the guise of a message from the United States Postal Service (USPS) regarding a missed package delivery.\nOverview\nA common thread between businesses and threat actors is that both are moving workloads previously handled by traditional web servers to the cloud. SentinelLabs has identified one example of this in the form of SNS Sender, a Python script that uses AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send bulk SMS messages for the purpose of spamming phishing links, aka Smishing.\nSNS Sender is the first script we encountered using AWS SNS to send spam texts. The script requires access to an AWS account in which the service was already provisioned, configured, and enabled. By default, AWS accounts are subject to restrictions through a feature called the SNS sandbox. These restrictions can be removed if the customer spends $1 and provides a viable use case to AWS support, who manually review such requests. While other tools like AlienFox have used business to customer (B2C) communications platforms such as Twilio to conduct SMS spamming attacks, we are unaware of existing research that details tools abusing AWS SNS to conduct such attacks.\nWe identified links between the actor behind this tool and many phishing kits used to target victims’ personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card details under the guise of a message from the United States Postal Service (USPS) regarding a missed package delivery. We believe this actor is using cloud services to send bulk SMS phishing messages, though they may still be testing the tool based on some questionable programming choices.\nScript Analysis\nSNS Sender is a script that enables bulk SMS spamming using AWS SNS. The script requires a list of phishing links named links.txt in its working directory. SNS Sender also takes several arguments that are entered as input:\nA text file containing a list of AWS access keys, secrets, and region delimited by a colon\nA text file containing a list of phone numbers to target\nA sender ID, similar to a display name for a message\nThe message content\nSNS Sender inputs and outputs\nThe send_sns_message function sets up the AWS boto3 client–an interface between the Python script and the AWS SNS backend–to send the SMS messages. The boto3 client variables are obtained through the arguments that the script user provided.\nThe sender ID variable is an interesting inclusion. According to AWS documentation, this variable is optional and is supported in some countries. In the United States, carriers do not support sender IDs, whereas in India, they are mandatory. The inclusion of a sender ID contrasts with the actor’s association with USPS-themed phishing kits targeting Americans. The oversight may indicate the actor is not familiar with this exception and likely resides in a country where the sender ID is commonplace.\nSNS Sender establishes a while loop that iterates through the list of AWS credentials and regions. The script replaces any occurrences of the string linkas in the message content variable with a URL from the links.txt file, which weaponizes the message as a phishing SMS. The link is selected randomly using the Python random library’s choice method.\nThe script tracks how many AWS access key pairs have been accessed through the a variable and how many phone numbers have been used through the y variable, which are initialized as 0 and incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Each message is sent using the credentials from one line from the AWS access key pair list, and the tracking ensures that the next line is accessed for the subsequent message.\nTo run at scale, the list would need to be incredibly long, and likely repeat access key & secret pairs, making this a coding method with questionable efficacy.\nPhishing Kits\nWhen investigating the handle ARDUINO_DAS, we identified more than 150 phishing kit files containing references to the actor. More than half of the kits are USPS-themed. The assets in these archives are similar in name to the URIs present in several recent Smishing campaigns using a missed package delivery lure. We believe that the actor abandoned the ARDUINO_DAS handle in 2023 after accusations that the actor scammed buyers. However, some recently circulated phishing kits still reference this handle, which may make it an artifact of actors using the phishing kit.\nDue to the link between ARDUINO_DAS and USPS phishing, we explored several active campaigns circulating through early January 2024, hosted on hxxps://usps[.]mytrackingh[.]top and hxxps://u-sipsl[.]cc. Both sites host a USPS-themed phishing site with a flow like:\nLanding Page: Explains to the visitor that their USPS package is unable to be delivered. The “Click Update” button leads to the next step.\nTracking Page: This page looks like USPS tracking details, but it prompts the victim to enter their name, physical address, phone number, and email address.\nCard Verification Page: This page prompts the user to enter a credit card number for a $0.30 redelivery fee.\nThe server forwards the details to a card checker, which is likely run through a Telegram service.\nLanding page for phishing flow\nPII theft form\nCredit card theft form\nConclusion\nActors are continuously finding new tools and platforms they can use to conduct their attack of choice, and SNS Sender is no exception. Spammers have used mega tools like AlienFox and Predator to target bulk mail services as well as business communications services. Other researchers have detailed which APIs have been used during in-the-wild AWS SNS abuse attacks, as well as enumeration routes actors may take to verify a targeted environment’s SNS capabilities. SNS Sender provides a glimpse into how actors conduct these attacks.\nSNS Sender represents a more narrow approach that relies on the actor having access to a properly configured AWS SNS tenant. Using AWS presents a challenge for this actor: AWS does not allow SMS notifications via SNS by default. For this feature to work, the tenant needs to be removed from the SNS sandbox environment. This is an update from previous research where AWS automatically allowed accounts to send to 10 destination numbers while an account is in the SNS sandbox.\nOrganizations using AWS SNS can protect themselves by reviewing the SNS documentation for the latest information. AWS has shared guidance for organizations to learn more about the SNS sandbox and how to change sending limits. Identity and Access Management (IAM) administrators should review identity best practices to optimize their organization’s security posture.\nDesire for recognition presents operational security challenges for actors developing tools for the opportunistic cloud hacking scene. The actor including their handle in the script is ubiquitous among cloud hack tools, enabling researchers to form a point of attribution even when delineating the tool families becomes challenging due
