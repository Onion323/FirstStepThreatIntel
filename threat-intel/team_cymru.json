      "content:encodedSnippet": "5 Reasons why the right tool is important for Success, Morale, and Team Value\n\nSecurity Operations Center (SOC) Tier 1 and 2 analysts play a critical role in protecting organizational assets from threats. However, given the pressures of the role, their effectiveness and job satisfaction are highly dependent on the quality and timeliness of the intelligence they receive. False positives are frustrating, not just time-wasting. According to Swimlane, one of the main causes of security analyst fatigue is “facing constant pressure to keep up with the latest threats and vulnerabilities.”\n\nThis highlights a need for technology to improve, in order to better support security analysts and keep them satisfied and more productive.\n\nThis means accurate and real-time insights are crucial not only for effective threat detection and response, but also for the overall well-being and productivity of SOC analysts. Let's explore why real-time insights are essential and how they enhance the value of analysts within the wider team.\n\n1. Enhancing Threat Detection and Response for SOC Analysts\n\nReal-time insights provide SOC analysts with the most current and actionable data, allowing them to detect and respond to threats as they emerge. This immediacy is crucial because threat actors move quickly, and any delay in detecting malicious activity can result in significant damage.

Real-time insights provide the necessary context to understand the nature and severity of a threat, its potential impact, and the best course of action.\n\nExample:\nWhen an unknown IP address is flagged, real-time context can reveal whether it belongs to a known malicious actor, its geographical location, and its historical behavior. This information enables analysts to make informed decisions quickly, reducing response times and improving incident management.\n\n4. Proactive Threat Hunting\n\nReal-time intelligence empowers experienced and senior SOC analysts to transition from a reactive to a proactive stance. With access to the latest threat data, analysts can identify and mitigate risks before they manifest into full-blown incidents.  This has been proven to save substantial effort in the costly clean up and remediate of a breach.\n\nExample:\nBy leveraging real-time data from Team Cymru, analysts can identify emerging threats and potential vulnerabilities within their network. This proactive approach not only enhances security but also boosts the morale and job satisfaction of analysts, as they feel more in control and effective in their roles.\n\n5. Supporting Team Collaboration and Value\n\nReal-time insights are invaluable not just for individual analysts but for the entire SOC team. Accurate insights with the additional context that Tier 1 Anakysts can provide facilitates better collaboration by providing a unified and up-to-date view of the threat landscape. This shared understanding enables coordinated responses and more effective threat management.\n\nExample:\nIn a collaborative environment, real-time threat intelligence ensures that all team members have access to the same current data, fostering a cohesive and coordinated approach to threat mitigation. This alignment improves overall team performance and highlights the collective value of the SOC to the broader organization.\n\nConclusion\n\nReal-time insights are a game-changer for SOC analysts, enhancing their ability to detect, respond to, and proactively hunt threats - as a team. Accurate insights reduce false positives, tagged results improve contextual understanding without the need for expertise, and all this comes together to support better team collaboration. For analysts, this translates to increased job satisfaction, as they can work more efficiently and effectively, making a tangible impact on their organization's security posture. By choosing real-time threat intelligence platforms like Team Cymru, organizations can empower their SOC teams to stay ahead of cyber threats and demonstrate their value within the wider security framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want real-time threat intelligence insights, enriched results, and quick, easy-to-understand insights, sign up for a Scout Insight today here.",

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Insights into Internet Outages along Africa's Western Coast\n\n\nAbout Team Cymru: Internet Weather Reports\n\nOur Internet weather reports are intended to provide data and technical analysis of significant events occurring across the Internet. The information aims to equip readers with insights that contribute to their own conclusions and provide additional context.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn 14 March 2024, a series of major Internet outages were reported, affecting thirteen African countries situated along the continent’s western coast. Up until the time of this blog post, there has been no conclusive reason as to why this happened.\n\nThis piqued our curiosity, prompting us to leverage our tools and data for a multinational and cross-continental analysis based on observed traffic patterns.\n\n\n\n\nThe impacted countries are highlighted in the map (of Africa!) above. However, for the cartophobic, the list from north to south, including country codes, is as follows:\n\nNiger (NE)\n\n  \nBurkina Faso (BF)\n\n  \nNigeria (NG)\n\n  \nThe Gambia (GM)\n\n  \nCameroon (CM)\n\n  \nGuinea (GN)\n\n  \nBenin (BJ)\n\n  \nGhana (GH)\n\n  \nTogo (TG)\n\n  \nCôte d'Ivoire (CI)\n\n  \nLiberia (LR)\n\n  \nNamibia (NA)\n\n  \nSouth Africa (ZA)\n\n\n\n\nOver a week later, in this blog post, we will examine the current status of the situation by analyzing high-level network telemetry data derived from Pure Signal™.\n\nKey Findings\n\nAt the time of writing, Cameroon is still experiencing ongoing Internet outages, over a week after the initial reports.\n\n  \nImpacted countries faced varying degrees of impact, ranging from minor blips within a 24-hour period to widespread outages lasting several days (or ongoing in the case of Cameroon).\n\n\n\n\nStatus Update\n\nCameroon (CM)\n\nBased on our vantage point, it is apparent that at least one country, Cameroon, is still impacted by the outages.\n\n\n\n\nAs depicted in the chart above, a decline in client (user) activity was observed on March 14 and has yet to return to the levels observed before the outages were reported.\n\nServer records were also affected, albeit on a smaller scale, primarily due to limited inbound connections to services and websites in Cameroon from other countries in general.\n\nFor clarity, client flows are those originating from an IP address located in the country of interest (e.g., country code CM in the chart above). Server flows are those where the destination IP address (server/service) was located in the country of interest. For example, a user in the United States accessing a website hosted in Cameroon.\n\n\nBenin (BJ) & Ghana (GH)\n\nSeveral other countries appear to have been impacted for several days. In the case of both Benin and Ghana, connectivity was dramatically and almost completely restored on 20 March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria (NG)\n\nA similar situation is observed in Nigeria, where, as of 20 March, normal service appears to have resumed. However, the 'return' seems to have been gradual over several days.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at server flow data for Ghana and Nigeria, it is evident that both countries host comparatively more services that are accessed by foreign users when compared with countries like Benin and Cameroon.\n\n\nNiger (NE)\n\nMuch like the other countries already reviewed, Niger appears to have experienced outages lasting several days. However, since 18 March, there has been a surge in Internet usage to 150-200% of the \"usual\" levels. This surge potentially indicates a nation catching up on “what was missed” over the preceding days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGambia (GM), Liberia (LR), Namibia (NA) & South Africa (ZA)\n\nIn some cases, impacts of the outages were limited to a single day, or not fully discernable in our daily snapshots. Liberia, for example, appears to have been impacted within a 24-hour period before returning to business as usual levels. In Namibia, there was a small reduction in traffic, but nothing which would indicate wide-scale Internet outage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurkina Faso (BF), Côte d’Ivoire (CI), Guinea (GN) and Togo (TG)\n\nFor the final four countries affected by the Internet outages, we witness a different phenomenon as a result of the intricacies of our vantage points into these particular countries. Instead of a drop in traffic, we see a sharp increase in the case of Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Togo. In each case, this increase lasts for 4-5 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we are observing here is likely attributable to one of two things (or a combination of both):\n\nAttempted and ultimately failed connections to external resources were being observed.\n\n  \nTraffic rerouted via indirect paths across the Internet were being observed.\n\n\n\n\nDigging deeper into the data for these four countries combined to examine the top TCP ports observed strengthens this assessment. As can be seen in the image below, the large increase in network traffic is a result of an increase in TCP/443 (generally associated with web browsing) traffic, which is highlighted in green.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the recent Internet outages affecting multiple countries along Africa's western coast have highlighted the vulnerability of digital connectivity in the region. While some nations experienced minor disruptions lasting less than a day, others faced prolonged and ongoing outages, exemplified by the situation in Cameroon.",

Octo is an attractive malware for cybercriminals because it features capabilities designed to target sensitive data. This information can be used to infiltrate company networks and amplify their impact.\n\nCombatting this threat is highly challenging as the threat landscape is complex\n\nBecause it is offered as a ‘Malware-as-a-Service’ mode’, many unsophisticated cyber criminals can exploit Octo resulting in an increasing number and variety of adversaries, making defense much harder.  In addition, the highly proficient operators of Octo malicious infrastructure use sophisticated techniques to avoid detection and stay ahead of traditional threat intelligence techniques. Octo developers and sellers are continuously evolving their software, further enabling cyber criminals through their support program.\n\nLarger organizations are vulnerable as it requires a multi-threaded strategic approach\n\nAs we will detail further, mitigating Octo requires planning, and that takes time.  Defensive measures involve enhancing authentication methods, educating stakeholders, customers, and employees on secure practices, creating specific cyber defense policies to discover and block malicious or suspicious activity, and empowering threat intelligence analyst teams to detect its presence across your entire digital landscape and third-party ecosystems.\n\nFinancial Fraud and Loss:\nOne of the primary risks is direct financial loss. Given that Octo malware targets financial institutions and their customers, organizations may suffer substantial financial fraud. This can result from unauthorized transactions, theft of funds, or compromise of financial credentials leading to broader financial exposure.\n\nData Breach and Loss of Sensitive Information:\nOcto malware's capabilities, such as keylogging and screen capturing, pose a significant risk of a sensitive data breach. This could include the theft of confidential corporate information, customer data, intellectual property, and more. Such breaches can lead to significant legal, financial, and reputational damage.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Violations:\nFor organizations under strict regulatory frameworks (such as GDPR, HIPAA, or financial regulations), a malware-induced data breach could lead to non-compliance issues. This might result in hefty fines, sanctions, or other regulatory actions, alongside the costs of remediation and implementing measures to prevent future incidents.\n\nReputational Damage:\nThe public exposure of a malware attack can severely damage an organization's reputation. Customers and partners may lose trust in the organization's ability to safeguard their financial assets, leading to loss of business, strained relationships, and difficulty in attracting new customers or partners.\n\nOperational Disruption:\nBeyond financial and data-related impacts, Octo malware infections can lead to significant operational disruptions. This could include the loss of access to critical systems, disruption of business processes, and the need to allocate significant resources to incident response and recovery efforts. For organizations in the Global 2000, such disruptions can have far-reaching ramifications, affecting operations worldwide and leading to substantial financial and operational setbacks.\n\nEffective mitigation against Octo malware is something that requires your team to leverage multiple tools, processes, and procedures.\n\nThis will likely include all of the following:\n\nEnhancing Detection and Response Capabilities:\nEnsure you have advanced threat detection systems and train incident response teams to recognize and respond to sophisticated malware incidents such as Octo.\n\nStrengthening Endpoint Security:\nEnsure all corporate devices, particularly Android, accessing your corporate networks have updated antivirus software and endpoint protection, in addition to the latest operating system updates and security patches. These updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities that malware like Octo/Octo may exploit.\n\nEnforce gateway security and improve customer support:\nEnsure all devices accessing financial systems and customer services can be identified and categorized.  Octo specifically targets Android devices, so ensuring your perimeter security can distinguish the mobile device and OS is critical.  When correlated with customer login credentials, your Customer Service team can proactively alert there is a threat.\n\nPromoting Cybersecurity Awareness:\nEnsure that mobile security-specific training sessions that include Octo attributes are made available for employees and customers, focused on recognizing account compromise attempts and securing personal devices.\n\nImplementing Alternative Strong Authentication Processes:\nOcto can intercept and read SMS on the device.  Multi-factor authentication for all banking applications and services, and access to corporate VPNs and networks should avoid the use of SMS to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and fraudulent activity.\n\nTactical steps from discovery to defense using the CTEM process\n\nImprove external visibility of digital assets & threats using the Pure Signal™ platform\n\n\nOur recent research, The Digital Risk Landscape: A Report on Top Financial Institutions & Third Party Risk, highlights the need to improve external visibility of external digital assets, and those of third parties.  This ensures that the entire risk landscape is fully scoped and includes every possible source of risk and threat.\n\nStart with Pure Signal™ Orbit’s asset discovery feature to discover, inventory, and manage external assets.\n\nMeasure levels of risk by classifying external assets\n\n\nOnce the asset landscape has been fully discovered and scoped, the next step is to assess the cloud platforms, systems, and technologies that are internet-facing.  This will create a list of assets that the Threat Intelligence Team can constantly monitor for suspicious or malicious activity related to Octo.\n\nPure Signal™ Orbit’s cloud platform and technologies features autonomously classify assets and provide a full view of the external systems that cybercriminals could potentially target, with information gained from using Octo malware.\n\nEnsure there is a plan to monitor and prioritize Octo-related activity\n\n\nBy leveraging the integration and automation capabilities of Pure Signal™ products, a real-time alert of suspicious or malicious activity will generate an action for assessment.\n\nPure Signal™ Scout is a simplified threat research analyst platform that enables team members of all experiences to triage a possible threat quickly, Octo will feature as a predefined Tag creating instant insights.  Using the combination of assets discovered in Pure Signal™ Orbit, and cross-referencing with Pure Signal™ Scout, a quick assessment can validate if action is needed, or not.  Use IoCs from the Octo blog to start.\n\nUse advanced tools and analysts to assess and validate\n\n\nOnce a possible or potential threat has been prioritized to a senior analyst to assess further, this is where real-time insights and expansive visibility outside network borders become a strategic advantage, as outlined in this case study.\n\nPure Signal™ Recon enables experienced analysts to expand the details and scale the analysis.  Octo leverages specific ports, and protocols, and appears legitimate by using self-signed certificates - all this is available to filter and query among 40+ datasets.  This method also expands across adversary and third-party infrastructure, enabling monitoring for external threats across a large threat landscape. Use IoCs from the Octo blog to start.\n\nIdentify octo-infected devices and take action\n\n\nApplying insights gained from the activities and processes above can enable various actions, such as:\nIdentify new and emergent infrastructure associated with the Octo malware.\n\n  \nMonitor for outbound communications from your own networks to both known Octo infrastructure, and potential new C2 servers as they are stood up over time.\n\n  \nAssess when victims of Octo are interacting with your own, or third party, infrastructure and networks.",

Its capabilities included keylogging, interception of push notifications and SMS messages, as well as control over the infected device’s screen.\n\nIn early 2022, researchers at ThreatFabric identified a post on an underground economy forum where the author sought information on the ‘Octo Android botnet’. Their analysis of this post established a direct link to ExobotCompact, a “lite” version of the aforementioned Exobot, which had been updated and rebranded as Octo.\n\nTherefore, Coper and Octo are considered synonymous names for the same malware family, which has evolved over time from its Exobot origins (circa 2016).\n\nToday, Coper/Octo is offered as malware-as-a-service, where customers are provided access to a panel and builder used to coordinate and execute campaigns. As a result, we observe Coper/Octo being used to target many countries across the globe in campaigns crafted to ‘appeal’ to specific audiences. The aforementioned fake “Personas'' application serves as a good example of the level of regional focus that the service can provide its customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, we will detail our analysis and understanding of the Coper/Octo Android malware, examining the malware’s continued development, as well as providing insights into attack patterns, infrastructure utilization and management, and hunting tips.\n\nKey Findings\n\nCoper/Octo, originating from the Exobot malware family, has evolved from its initial observations in 2021 targeting Colombian Android users. It has transformed into a malware-as-a-service operation, providing customers with a range of malicious capabilities. The malware's distribution includes tactics such as impersonating legitimate applications like banking apps to deceive users into installing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nThe malware offers a variety of advanced features, including keylogging, interception of SMS messages and push notifications, and control over the device's screen. It employs various injects to steal sensitive information, such as passwords and login credentials, by displaying fake screens or overlays. Additionally, it utilizes VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote access to devices, enhancing its surveillance capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nCoper/Octo operates through a complex command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, encrypting communications to evade detection. Analysis of C2 servers reveals an understanding of victim targeting, with notable concentrations in countries like Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United States. The malware employs techniques to filter out certain regions, ensuring its operations align with the interests of its operators while evading detection in specific geopolitical areas.\n\n\n\n\nMalware Analysis\n\nInitial Command and Control Capabilities\n\nFirstly, we will examine the Coper/Octo malware payload which has been updated over the last few years to include new features and provide greater \"user\" flexibility. This flexibility becomes evident when we examine the malware configuration, which is set by each customer/operator.\n\nAfter the initial compromise and once communication with the C2 server is established, the Coper/Octo bot payload is passed to the victim device. The payload includes the configuration file, the parameters of which include:\n\nblock_push_apps: blocks push notifications for the listed applications.\n\n  \ndesired_apps: specifies the applications targeted by the malware.\n\n  \ndomains_bot: provides the C2 server for bot communications. This field is combined with the extra_domains field, which serves as backup C2 information.\n\n  \nkeylogger_enabled: a binary field determining whether the keylogging function is switched on or off.\n\n\n\n  \ninjects_list: the chosen injects the bot will deploy when a targeted application is accessed. Used in conjunction with injects_to_disable. We will cover injects in further detail below.\n\n  \nnet_delay: determines the time delta for network requests, i.e., communications with the C2 server.\n\n  \nsmarts_ver: determines the inject version to be utilized. Again we will cover this field in further detail below.\n\n  \nuninstall_apps: a list of applications to be uninstalled from the infected device. Used in tandem with uninstall_delay to specify the interval when this action takes place.\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned smarts_ver configuration field relates to the injects functionality embedded into the Coper/Octo bot and the C2 infrastructure used to manage it. The smarts information is further broken down into a separate table, likely to facilitate easier management.\n\nThis table contains information such as the inject and target type, as well as specific characteristics of the inject, such as how extracted data should be formatted and whether the inject is currently active or not. An example of this table is provided below.\n\n\n\n\nFrom left to right, the data in the table is explained as follows:\n\n1, 2, 3 are the inject IDs\n\n  \nHTML is the inject type\n\n  \nspecials indicates that the inject is part of the default build provided when the bot is installed; these injects cannot be removed\n\n  \nGmail, pattern, pin are the inject payloads, followed by the path (denoted by the %FIELD_ value)\n\n  \n1 is an “is alive” value, where in the case of the three injects shown this is “true”\n\n\n\n\nCoper/Octo supports several injects, for example:\n\nAccessibility Index: Displays instructions on how to enable Accessibility Services, which are required to be activated in order to facilitate remote interactions with the infected device. A degree of social engineering is employed to encourage the victim to take this action\n\n  \nFake Pattern: Displays a ‘fake’ unlock pattern screen to the victim user. This allows for the capture of the unlock pattern required to access the device, which is of particular value for VNC interactions\n\n  \nGmail Fake: Displays a ‘fake’ Gmail login form to the victim user. Steps are taken to make this form feel/look realistic, for example the user’s email address is prepopulated requiring only the password to be submitted. The obvious end goal being the theft of email login credentials\n\n  \nURL Inject: Displays an overlay web page, such as an authentication form, when the victim user accesses an app. The URL inject allows for the harvesting of credentials from any accounts or applications the operator wishes to target. The inputted data and cookie information are transferred back to the control server as with the other injects.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the configuration file and injects, the operator can further interact with the malware using a series of commands. All requests to/from the C2 infrastructure are AES encrypted and Base64 encoded. Examples of these commands include:\n\ndelete_bot: delete the Coper/Octo bot\n\n  \nintercept_off / _on: disables or enables SMS interception\n\n  \nlock_off / _on: unlock or lock the infected device\n\n  \nopen_url: open a web page in the infected device’s default browser\n\n  \nset_vnc_task: provide a remote action command, e.g., a gesture\n\n  \nsms: used to send an SMS message from the infected device (to a specific phone number)\n\n  \nstart_ / stop_keylogger: starts or stops keylogging on the infected device\n\n  \nvnc_start / _stop: starts or stops VNC functionality - i.e., remote control of the device/screen\n\n\n\n\nOperators can also set further parameters to extract detailed information from the infected device, as summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\n\nMany of these parameters existed in earlier versions of Coper/Octo from around mid-2021, and Exobot dating as far back as 2018, indicating the malware's development over time and the connections between the families.\n\nWith an understanding of how the operators communicate with each infected device (or “bot”), we can now delve into more detail about how this story unfolds, with the support of examples and images.\n\nVictim Registration and Filtering\n\nWhen a victim device is initially registered with the bot C2 server, essential information such as the IMEI number, phone model, Android version, device uptime, etc., is collected and stored in an SQL database. This data serves as a reference for the threat operator and can be reviewed in the future.\n\nFollowing registration, the victim device continues to send updates to the C2 server on a daily basis. These updates allow the threat operator to monitor their infections and compile user interactions with the victim devices.\n\nThe screenshot below illustrates the bot registration script, providing a detailed view of these information values, denoted as $value (e.g., $imei and $model).\n\n\n\n\nTwo values hold particular significance during the bot registration stage: $country and $lang. Like many malware families, Coper/Octo prohibits the infection of devices in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and/or devices utilizing the official languages of these countries.\n\nThis means that for customers of Coper/Octo, victims in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are strictly out of scope. The filter is applied by the malware authors and is present in all standard distributions of the malware.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, eagle-eyed readers will notice that victims in China (cn) and Ukraine (ua) are also prohibited.\n\nThe process of checking against language and country filters occurs alongside checks to ensure that the victim device is not an emulator or running on a virtual machine, resulting in three distinct reasons why a bot may be rejected in the registration process..\n\n\n\n\nOnce the registration process has successfully occurred and regular updates are being received from the bot, the threat operator can begin to interact further using the commands and features outlined previously.\n\nEncryption / Evading Detection\n\nTo evade detection, all Dex classes associated with Coper/Octo are encrypted using a hardcoded RC4 key, following the encryption routine illustrated below.\n\n\n\n\nWith knowledge of the routine and the hardcoded key (lU0jgv9f6hgMZI48x) we are better equipped to understand the Coper/Octo code, including its functionalities and interactions with the C2 infrastructure.\n\nUsing CyberChef, we can input encrypted strings as follows, with the output being the decrypted string in plain text.\n\n\n\n\nWe can then use this process to decipher the encrypted information described above, for example the below screenshot has the plain text values for a number of encrypted strings commented out.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the usage of encryption, Coper/Octo seeks to hide its tracks in other ways. Indeed, the use of certain permissions like REQUEST_COMPANION_RUN_IN_BACKGROUND and REQUEST_COMPANION_USE_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND indicates a level of stealthiness sought by Coper/Octo. \n\nThese permissions are commonly utilized by Android malware to ensure their operations remain inconspicuous in the background, reducing the likelihood of detection by the device's user. By running discreetly and utilizing data in the background, the malware can execute its malicious activities without drawing attention to itself, thereby maximizing its effectiveness in compromising the victim's device.\n\nCapabilities in Action\n\nKeylogging\n\nThe keylogger functionality is a primary feature of Coper/Octo, enabling it to log every keystroke made on the victim’s phone. Upon activation, Coper/Octo checks the status of the keylogger by verifying the value \"keylogger_enabled=1\". If enabled, it captures all information entered by the victim via the keyboard, including events and taps on the device. This encompasses application passwords, graphical patterns, PINs, push notifications, and screen passwords. Furthermore, the keylogger retrieves data from the device's web browser. In cases where the keylogger is not initially enabled, it can be activated later through the C2 panel.\n\nAll keylogged information is stored in a file within the device's data directory. Once the contents of the keylogger data file have been fully read, the file is deleted. This indicates a policy of utilizing the storage space once and temporarily, potentially for operational security reasons and to prevent sensitive data from remaining accessible on the filesystem, which could serve as evidence of the device's compromise.\n\nInjects\n\nInjects also play a crucial role in the Coper/Octo service offering, providing customers with a wide range of data theft mechanisms, as previously described. These injects are initially configured in the bot but can be later modified from the customer's C2 panel. Below is an example of a URL inject designed to target Gmail user information, using an overlaid “spoofed” login form to capture the victim’s credentials.\n\n\n\n\nBreaking this screenshot down step by step:\n\nFirstly, the inject type is defined, in this case, “url”\n\n  \nNext, it injects “onblur” event handlers in order to capture user inputs\n\n  \nThen, the HTML content of the page is updated with genuine device and application information, increasing ‘realism’\n\n  \nFinally, the captured Gmail credentials are stored in the file “gmail_login”\n\n\n\n\nInjects can also be used, as referenced previously, to obtain the infected device’s screen password or PIN, enabling remote access and management of the device.\n\n\n\n\nVNC (Remote Access)\n\nCoper/Octo is not unique among Android malware families in adopting VNC into its bag of tricks, with other notable examples including Godfather, Hook, and Vultur.\n\nVNC provides an alternative option for monitoring user input, such as using its screen recording capabilities to capture information inputted into things like banking services, or applications and websites of interest. In this way, VNC serves as the third \"alternative\" to inject and keylogging capabilities.\n\nTo execute all of its VNC features, Coper/Octo requires permissions for the Accessibility Service to be granted; we previously covered an inject used to socially engineer the victim into activating this.\n\nOnce permissions are granted, VNC is utilized for a number of purposes, including:\n\nEnabling or disabling device sounds, which is useful when the operator wants to capture things like SMS messages or push notifications\n\n  \nEnabling the virtual keyboard, allowing the operator to enter information into the infected device.\n\n  \nModifying the device backlight, which can potentially be used to interact with the device while it appears to be in sleep mode\n\n  \nSending pattern codes to unlock the device\n\n  \nTaking device screenshots (the process of which is illustrated in the screenshot below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferring to the table of parameters used by Coper/Octo, we can observe that an action request is made (xc) for a screenshot to be taken (vncScr), with a filename defined (fn) and an image body to be saved (bs) as a Base64 string.\n\nSMS Message Interaction\n\nThe final capability we'll examine is Coper/Octo's ability to interact with SMS messaging services, allowing it to intercept, read, and send messages within the device.\n\nAs with other aspects of the malware, the initial step is to ensure that the required permissions are granted.\n\n\n\n\nOnce confirmed, the bot will initiate the SMS interception process, whilst simultaneously aborting the SMSReceived broadcast to the victim (using the command “EXC_SMSRCV”), meaning notifications for new messages are no longer served to the victim user.\n\nIn the below screenshot we have used the aforementioned decryption process (see the section on Encryption / Evading Detection) to help illustrate the SMS interception process.\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, referring to the table of parameters used by Coper/Octo, we can observe that the SMS address (sender) is defined (sA), along with the message body (sB) and timestamp (sT).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this capability enables the operator to read messages received by the victim and send out new messages from the compromised device. This functionality might be utilized as a method for further onward infection of other devices, possibly by persuading the recipient(s) to download a malicious application.\n\nC2 Infrastructure Overview & Stats\n\nBefore looking into campaign and victim statistics, let's delve deeper into how the Coper/Octo bot communicates with operator C2 infrastructure, expanding on the previous section discussed at the beginning of this blog post. \n\nWe will outline the process by which the C2 server gathers information from the bots, explain how we decrypt this data, and then transition into examining the characteristics of the C2 servers, facilitating the discovery of other infrastructure connected to Coper/Octo.\n\nAs referenced previously, communications between the bot and C2 server are AES encrypted and Base64 encoded.\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, there is a means to decrypt the traffic and subsequently have a clear view of the communications, providing us with context on who is being targeted and what types of information the threat operators are particularly interested in\n\nWe will use the public sandbox from Triage for our analysis, as they have developed a configuration extractor for Coper/Octo, which makes all our lives easier (thanks for that!).\n\nOnce we have submitted the payload to the sandbox, a few interesting findings become available to us:\n\nC2 information associated with the payload (in this case, a number of similar domains which resolve to 94.156.68.191)\n\n  \nThe applications targeted by the malware, which include a large number of banking applications\n\n  \nThe AES key, which we can use to decrypt the C2 communications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe communications captured during the sandbox run can be downloaded in PCAP format, which can be analyzed further using a tool such as Wireshark.\n\n\n\n\nAt this stage, the data remains encrypted. However, we can extract it as a hex stream to transfer it to a decryption tool. Also, note the aforementioned C2 server, 94.156.68.191, observed in the captured communications.\n\n\n\n\nThe final step is to combine the extracted data from Wireshark with the AES key provided in our sandbox run. As before, we will use CyberChef to assist us with this step.\n\n\n\n\nThe output corresponds to the decrypted data, which contains all the parameters for this payload. Once beautified, it becomes easier to read and understand.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the payload is impersonating the Facebook application. We can also observe the language used in the prompt to encourage the victim to activate the Accessibility Service permissions required for the bot to operate fully.\n\nIn the bottom half of the screenshot, we observe further parameters being passed to provide information about the victim host, for example:\n\niA = 0: the trojan is NOT the default SMS manager\n\n  \niAc = 1: the trojan has Accessibility Services access\n\n  \niBC = 100: the device is at 100% charge\n\n  \nkL = 1: the keylogger is enabled\n\n  \nrTS = 1707298428: the timestamp for the information provided (unix time corresponding to 7 February 2024 09:33:48)\n\n\n\n\nThe final bullet point serves as a lasting alibi for our malware analyst in case of the question “where were you on 7 February at 9:30 am?”.\n\nHaving repeated this process on numerous occasions with different payloads, we found that the parameter lB can offer up some interesting data points. In the case we have described in this blog, the lB parameter indicated the identity of the malicious spoofed application (Facebook) used as a lure.\n\nIn addition to Facebook, we have seen recent campaigns impersonating Google Chrome, as well as a number of Poker applications.\n\nHowever, in other cases, we have often observed the lB parameter containing the value ‘apkcrypt’, indicating that a different crypter had been used compared to the usual one we observe in the analysis of Coper/Octo. It is not clear why this happened, but it may suggest that the malware author collaborates with more than one crypter service.\n\nIt's the Same, but Different\n\nAs mentioned previously, Coper/Octo operates as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering, with customization placed into the hands of its customers. However, there are some constants (outside of elements of the malware code) that we can focus on to identify connected infrastructure.\n\nOne such constant is the X.509 certificate utilized for Coper/Octo C2 servers.\n\nExamining another C2 server to the one mentioned above, 91.240.118.224 appears to have been used in Coper/Octo campaigns commencing on 5 February 2024, based on uploads to VirusTotal. Our own analysis of the IP also identifies it as a Coper/Octo controller.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to our data holdings, 91.240.118.224 appears to be hosting what seems to be a fairly generic X.509 certificate.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when expanding our query to seek further examples of IPs hosting an X.509 certificate with a subject value of ‘CN=www.example.com,OU=Department,O=Company’, we find that there are surprisingly few candidates.\n\n\n\n\nIn total, we found 84 other IPs hosting a certificate that matched the same subject value, dating back to mid-January 2024.\n\nA search of Censys records returned a similarly low number of results.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we analyzed the resulting IPs, we found that, aside from a small number of false positives, this certificate value was a strong indicator of Coper/Octo infrastructure. The majority of the servers we identified as Coper/Octo were located in Russia or the Netherlands.\n\nAdditionally, we observed that while the certificates mainly appeared to be generated for each new C2 server, there was also evidence of Coper/Octo customers moving their infrastructure. In these cases, we found that the certificate serial number and associated C2 URL string remained the same, even when moving from one IP address to another, as illustrated below.\n\n\n\n\nHaving filtered out false positives, we are now able to monitor all active C2 servers to gain a high-level understanding of current campaigns, drawing out the number of victims and the regions targeted.\n\nReturning to 91.240.118.224 as an example, at the time of our analysis we found that it had 486 bots connected to it, with approximately 80% of these victims located in Turkey.\n\n\nExpanding this to look at all active Coper/Octo C2 servers we were aware of at the time of this analysis, we found there to be a total of nearly 45,000 bots, with nearly 700,000 SMS messages intercepted from them.\n\nWhen mapping out the locations of the victims, four countries stand out in particular as being heavily targeted by Coper/Octo campaigns (disclaimer - at the time of our analysis): Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis of the Coper/Octo Android malware-as-a-service operation sheds light on the sophisticated and evolving nature of mobile malware threats. From its origins in the Exobot family to its current status as a full-fledged malware service, Coper/Octo represents a potential risk to Android users worldwide. Its range of capabilities, including keylogging, injects, and VNC remote access, underscores the need for heightened vigilance and security measures among mobile device users.\n\nFurthermore, the examination of Coper/Octo's infrastructure and targeting strategies highlights the global reach and strategic focus of its operators. By understanding the intricacies of its command-and-control infrastructure and victim targeting patterns, security researchers can better mitigate the threat posed by this malware and protect users from falling victim to its malicious activities.\n\nAs the threat landscape continues to evolve, it is imperative for both users and security professionals to remain proactive in identifying and addressing emerging threats like Coper/Octo. By staying informed about the latest developments in mobile malware and implementing robust security measures, we can collectively work towards a safer and more secure mobile ecosystem for all users.\n\nRecommendations\n\nUsers of Pure Signal™ Recon can identify Coper/Octo infrastructure based on tags, and gain more precision with an X.509 query using the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nO: Company\nCN: www.example.com\nSubject: OU=Department\nPort: 443\n\nUsers of Pure Signal™ Scout can use the advanced query language to identify Coper/Octo infrastructure based on tags.\n\n  \nEnsure that all mobile devices, particularly Android devices, are running the latest operating system updates and security patches. These updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities that malware like Coper/Octo may exploit.\n\n  \nConsider installing reputable antivirus software on Android devices to detect and remove malware infections. Regularly scan devices for suspicious activity and malware signatures.\n\n  \nBe vigilant when downloading and installing applications from third-party sources or unknown developers.\n\n\n\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nhttps://karmelinanoonethousandbaby[.]net/YzI4MGFhZjI2MmM5/\nhttps://185.198.69[.]111/NTBiZmM4ZDQ2MWY2/\nhttps://2.57.149[.]150/ZTIwNDEzZjM4YjYw/\nhttps://2istanbullu2586[.]xyz/ZTIwNDEzZjM4YjYw/\nhttps://83.97.73[.]195/MzZhMGJjZTJkOGI3/\nhttps://o3c31x4fqdw2[.]lt/MTU2OWE0NzJjNGY5/\nhttps://0n75w55jyk66[.]pw/MTU2OWE0NzJjNGY5/\nhttps://91.240.118[.]224/NjQyNDcyMjE3ZWU3/\nhttps://sanagerekkalmaz1453[.]shop/MTFiMzQ4NGQ2MWU4/\nhttps://185.122.204[.]122/MDViMDU3NDYwMTBm/",

      "content:encodedSnippet": "A senior stakeholder explainer for Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)\n\nCybersecurity in the Era of Continuous Threats: The Case for CTEM\n\nTraditional approaches to cybersecurity no longer provide sufficient defense. Enterprises are missing an opportunity to reduce their exposure to threats through siloed and tool-centric methods of risk and threat detection. The need for a proactive, integrated strategy is clear, and Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) stands at the forefront of this transformation.\n\nFor CISOs, the key benefit of Implementing CTEM is to provide your organization with strategic advantages, aligning cybersecurity efforts with business goals. It ensures that security investments are prioritized based on actionable intelligence, reducing the likelihood of breaches.\n\nWhy is CTEM so important to consider as a strategy? Gartner predicts that by 2026, organizations employing CTEM will be three times less likely to suffer from a breach.\n\nUnderstanding CTEM\n\nCTEM is not a fleeting trend but an essential systemic approach to refining an organization's security posture amidst a landscape where threats outpace traditional defenses. The premise is simple yet profound: zero-day vulnerabilities, while significant, are not the primary culprits behind breaches. Instead, a successful protection approach marries the readiness for unknown threats with a strategic emphasis on publicly known vulnerabilities and identified control gaps.\n\nAs business environments grow in complexity, with technological expansions both on-premises and in the cloud, the attack surface widens. New technologies and business initiatives like SaaS applications, IoT, and supply chain touchpoints introduce new vulnerabilities. In response, security leaders are increasingly recognizing the inadequacy of preventative-only strategies and are turning to more mature, multi-faceted tactics that include detection and response capabilities.\n\nThe Financial Imperative\n\nThe shift to CTEM is not just about bolstering defenses—it's a financial imperative. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report, the average cost of a data breach reached an all-time high of $4.45 million in 2023. These staggering figures underscore the criticality of managing exposure through a structured, iterative process like CTEM.  If there’s ever a motivation to pivot to a new cyber strategy, financial implications are high up there.\n\nCTEM in Action: A Five-Step Cycle with Practical Steps\n\nA mature CTEM program encompasses a five-step cycle: scoping, discovery, prioritization, validation, and mobilization. This cycle ensures that outputs from exposure management contribute to multiple parts of the security and IT organizations, facilitating a holistic management approach to a wide set of exposures. It's a cyclical, iterative process that demands regular, repeatable steps to ensure consistent outcomes.\n\n1. Scoping: Defining Your Battlefield\n\nPractical Steps:\n\n  \nInventory digital assets, including cloud instances, endpoints, and operational technology.\n\n  \nDefine business-critical systems and data, focusing on what is essential to protect.\n\n  \nEstablish governance to manage CTEM with clear roles and responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n2. Discovery: Identifying the Known and Unknown\n\nPractical Steps:\n\n  \nImplement comprehensive scanning tools for vulnerability assessment.\n\n  \nEngage in threat intelligence services to stay abreast of the evolving threat landscape.\n\n  \nConduct regular penetration testing to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n3. Prioritization: Making Informed Decisions\n\n\n\n  \nPractical Steps:\n\n  \nUse risk-based vulnerability management tools to evaluate the severity and impact of each threat.\n\n  \nAlign security measures with business impact, prioritizing actions that protect the most critical assets.\n\n  \nFoster collaboration between IT \nand business units to ensure risk assessments are business-aware.\n\n\n\n\n4. Validation: Testing Your Defenses\n\nPractical Steps:\n\n  \nValidate remediation and mitigation actions through simulated attack scenarios.\n\n  \nReview security policies and practices to ensure they are effective and up-to-date.\n\n  \nEstablish metrics and KPIs to measure the effectiveness of your security posture.\n\n\n\n\n5. Mobilization: Orchestrating Response and Remediation\n\nPractical Steps:\n\n  \nDevelop and test incident response plans that include CTEM insights.\n\n  \nTrain employees on security awareness and response protocols.\n\n  \nEstablish a cross-functional CTEM team to manage and act on CTEM outputs.\n\n\n\n\nCTEM in Action: Strategic Advantages and Outcomes\n\nEnhanced Risk-Based Decision Making\nIn the boardrooms of companies, the conversation around cybersecurity is increasingly tied to risk management.

It is too costly for a company not to strategize to find a way to ensure security using risk and threat platforms. NIST is very timely to introduce this guidance for all company sizes as supply chain and third-party cybersecurity is a problem everyone owns. It requires a unique approach that combines real-time threat intelligence, continuous asset discovery, and increased collaboration for parent companies, subsidiaries, and partners.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>NIST now provides guidance and examples for its 2.0 framework for companies of any size. If you have enterprise customers, you may feel the effects of the 2.0 Cybersecurity Framework as recommendations are being translated by larger organizations into new security and audit requirements for their suppliers and third-party services. There is no getting away from the fact NIST 2.0 is a sizable body of work. Instead of rattling off all the changes, let&apos;s discuss where security leaders should take note</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4f5c36_10c04d0548b24d97aba7e81b02a0d59a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<h3>DPRM Platforms Play Center Stage in the NIST 2.0 Cyber Security Framework</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Are large enterprise organizations amongst your customers or your does your company play a role in the supply chain delivery of a customer or critical service?</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The new &quot;Govern&quot; function and its <u><a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/08/07/CSF%202.0%20Core%20with%20Examples%20Discussion%20Draft%5B74%5D.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">implementation examples</a></u> show how <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/glossary-of-terms\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DPRM</a></u> solutions are the cornerstone to providing the cybersecurity risk inputs needed to fortify overall risk planning and incident response. Nowhere is that emphasis more apparent than in the new &quot;Govern&quot; function, providing cross-functional recommendations and examples aimed at better executive collaboration. The Govern functions lend more clarity to categorizing assets so that security leaders can take a more proactive approach and prioritize response.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">You may be one step ahead if you already use the inputs from a DPRM platform. If your team engaged in these activities, you may have a short path to show alignment with NIST 2.0 recommendations. Ensure the tools you use can keep pace and enable the benefits of proactive defense. Here are some salient points to think about when considering a threat and risk management platform to realize the advantages contained in the 2.0 cybersecurity framework recommendations.</span></span></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Do you have a DPRM solution that provides:</span></span></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Multi-score impact methodology that considers the severity of the vulnerability via</span></span><u><a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> CVSS scoring</span></span></a></u><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> critical aspects of the infrastructure and includes other factors, such as manual inputs, to generate a score.</span></span></p></li>\n  <li><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Automates the impact score on an asset using CVSS scoring, combined with human and AI/ML generated input.</span></span></p></li>\n  <li><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Continual asset discovery – Shadow IT requires SecOps to diligently discover and inventory new IT systems as they are added to the external attack surface you monitor.</span></span></p></li>\n  <li><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Integration opportunities with GRC systems and other business management systems via API</span></span></p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Supply Chain Security Measures Go Mainstream with NIST 2.0 Recommendations</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Many security leaders likely didn’t need reminders about supply chain risk.

Then, NIST released its <u><a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/08/nist-drafts-major-update-its-widely-used-cybersecurity-framework\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first update to its Cybersecurity Framework</a></u>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4f5c36_b9bf62000e2b412a96a606e3d739ebf3~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_742,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you need to act now or wait until a later point, you need to know about the new NIST 2.0 recommendations and prepare. If you are with a parent company with a long list of supply chain partners, you must bring them into your cybersecurity programs. </p>\n<p>The infrastructure you need to secure is your partner&apos;s rather than yours. But at the same time, you are still responsible for any breach resulting from their cybersecurity shortcomings.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"><strong>If you are in an industry where a customer and/or critical system relies on third-party services, you are responsible for the breach regardless of the source.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>So, as a security leader, how do you put another company&apos;s assets under your purview and collaborate to reduce risk?  </p>\n<p>Ultimately, you are responsible for your and your supply chain partners&apos; security shortcomings.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The NIST release of 2.0 recommendations and implementation examples highlight the minimum capabilities needed for increased supply chain security; the timing could not be better.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Learn about NIST 2.0 now to avoid becoming a statistic in the future\n\nBy 2025, 45% of all organizations will have experienced a cyber-attack through a supply chain partner.\n\nThis explains why we are now seeing more inquiries and discussions about the NIST 2.0 Cybersecurity Framework from our customer base, this blog seeks to discuss the topic for senior cybersecurity stakeholders.  This revised framework is not just a compliance checklist; it's a strategic tool to enhance overall security resilience and align with industry-leading practices.\n\nAs a security leader responsible for threat intelligence and hunting, this blog is an excellent primer to help you navigate the new NIST 2.0 framework and align your team and organization to it.\n\nKeep reading and learn about:\nThe new Govern section and how to align risk management to business functions and company strategies.\n\n  \nHow to use DPRM solutions for the cybersecurity risk inputs needed to fortify overall risk planning and incident response.\n\n  \nWhat provisions you need to make for privacy, supply chain security, and the incorporation of new technologies.\n\n  \nWhy automating asset discovery and continual prioritization leads lower risks from supply chain partners. \n\n  \nHow to drive up the cost for a threat actor to attack your organization using collaborative efforts.\n\n  \nActionable insights for implementing NIST 2.0, tailored to cater to different cybersecurity maturity levels within organizations. \n\n\n\n\nWith the significant changes that 2.0 brings, it's clear that NIST wants to make its framework more accessible. It's a smart move when you consider that the majority of news-worthy cyber-attacks happen through supply chain partners. Not only that, but the number of cyber-attacks has risen considerably. Some Other sources indicate more than a 200% YoY increase in supply chain cyber-attacks, representing a significant step forward in guiding organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity measures.\n\nNIST 2.0 Focuses on Reducing Risk For Companies of All Sizes\n\nRegardless of the industry analyst or news source, it would be hard to disagree that supply chain and third-party cyber-attacks are increasing exponentially.\n\nThe challenge is that large organizations must find ways to protect what isn't theirs, as they are still held liable for cybersecurity oversights at the supply chain and third-party levels. It is too costly for a company not to strategize to find a way to ensure security using risk and threat platforms. NIST is very timely to introduce this guidance for all company sizes as supply chain and third-party cybersecurity is a problem everyone owns. It requires a unique approach that combines real-time threat intelligence, continuous asset discovery, and increased collaboration for parent companies, subsidiaries, and partners.\n\nNIST now provides guidance and examples for its 2.0 framework for companies of any size. If you have enterprise customers, you may feel the effects of the 2.0 Cybersecurity Framework as recommendations are being translated by larger organizations into new security and audit requirements for their suppliers and third-party services. There is no getting away from the fact NIST 2.0 is a sizable body of work. Instead of rattling off all the changes, let's discuss where security leaders should take note\n\n\nDPRM Platforms Play Center Stage in the NIST 2.0 Cyber Security Framework\n\nAre large enterprise organizations amongst your customers or your does your company play a role in the supply chain delivery of a customer or critical service?\n\nThe new \"Govern\" function and its implementation examples show how DPRM solutions are the cornerstone to providing the cybersecurity risk inputs needed to fortify overall risk planning and incident response. Nowhere is that emphasis more apparent than in the new \"Govern\" function, providing cross-functional recommendations and examples aimed at better executive collaboration. The Govern functions lend more clarity to categorizing assets so that security leaders can take a more proactive approach and prioritize response.\n\nYou may be one step ahead if you already use the inputs from a DPRM platform. If your team engaged in these activities, you may have a short path to show alignment with NIST 2.0 recommendations. Ensure the tools you use can keep pace and enable the benefits of proactive defense. Here are some salient points to think about when considering a threat and risk management platform to realize the advantages contained in the 2.0 cybersecurity framework recommendations.\n\nDo you have a DPRM solution that provides:\nMulti-score impact methodology that considers the severity of the vulnerability via CVSS scoring critical aspects of the infrastructure and includes other factors, such as manual inputs, to generate a score.\n\n  \nAutomates the impact score on an asset using CVSS scoring, combined with human and AI/ML generated input.\n\n  \nContinual asset discovery – Shadow IT requires SecOps to diligently discover and inventory new IT systems as they are added to the external attack surface you monitor.\n\n  \nIntegration opportunities with GRC systems and other business management systems via API\n\n\n\n\nSupply Chain Security Measures Go Mainstream with NIST 2.0 Recommendations\n\nMany security leaders likely didn’t need reminders about supply chain risk. But, you know it's time to get even more serious about supply chain security when Homeland Security builds a new supply chain risk management office. Then, NIST released its first update to its Cybersecurity Framework.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether you need to act now or wait until a later point, you need to know about the new NIST 2.0 recommendations and prepare. If you are with a parent company with a long list of supply chain partners, you must bring them into your cybersecurity programs. \nThe infrastructure you need to secure is your partner's rather than yours. But at the same time, you are still responsible for any breach resulting from their cybersecurity shortcomings.\n\nIf you are in an industry where a customer and/or critical system relies on third-party services, you are responsible for the breach regardless of the source.\n\nSo, as a security leader, how do you put another company's assets under your purview and collaborate to reduce risk?  \nUltimately, you are responsible for your and your supply chain partners' security shortcomings.\n\nThe NIST release of 2.0 recommendations and implementation examples highlight the minimum capabilities needed for increased supply chain security; the timing could not be better. Due diligence will always depend on human interactions and assessments, as it should be. At the same time, a lot of tedious and manual work goes into assessing risk. So, the more you can increase the efficacy, automation, and coverage of your cybersecurity programs to include key partner relationships, the better off you will be in the long term. \n\nSupporting supply chain partners by collaborating on cybersecurity is a win-win situation for everyone involved. Here are some key ways that a DPRM solution can augment your supply chain security program:\n\nMultiple risk scores – DPRM platforms enable multiple scores by business unit, subsidiary, supply chain partners, and third-party services.\n\n  \nCreate specific groups – Monitor risk by groups you create, such as function, geography, partner, or type of service, to measure individual and overall group risk scores.\n\n  \nBenchmark – Compare business risk scores to highlight weak links. Evaluate similar groups, partners, or applications against each other to benchmark risk reduction across groups and identify security gaps.\n\n  \nAutomate scanning and discovery – Supply chain and third-party service partners should have their infrastructure scanned and assessed regularly. Partners should be able to show improvement from past scans, such as reducing the number or severity of vulnerabilities within their infrastructure.\n\n  \nMap vulnerabilities of a group of partners to track the overall and individual risk scores and provide guidance for remediation where possible. \n\n\n\n\nAutomate Asset Discovery and Continual Prioritization for In-Depth Situational Awareness\n\n\n\nCorporate IT environments are constantly in flux, with new applications being spun up and business units sometimes going rogue and standing up new infrastructure. It's hard to keep up with, even with visibility into your infrastructure. Nowhere is automated asset discovery needed more than for your externally exposed infrastructure. Once you have performed your initial in-depth discovery, it must be followed up with frequent scans as new software, configuration changes, and admin updates will affect the risk score of that asset.\n\nDiscovery is just the beginning; it is just one facet of managing vulnerabilities.

Solutions that can automate prioritizing assets by bringing together CVSS severity scores along with business impact scoring will give vulnerability management teams the automation they need to weed through the noise of low-level alerts and concentrate on what matters most. So, what is the best way to prioritize assets? Because what matters most is not always a straightforward answer.\n\nConsider these attributes when looking to prioritize response.\nSeverity – The first step is ascertaining the vulnerability severity. If exploited, how much damage would it cause? To a certain extent, business context is needed, but you can make a reasonable estimate based on your knowledge of your software and hardware environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nLikelihood – This can be defined by the exposure of a system to your external attack surface, the frequency of threats or exploits, and how much publicity the vulnerability has received. But probably the indicator of likelihood is the capabilities and motivations of attackers. This may be a more important attribute if you suffer from repeated attacks and relentless threat actors.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nRisk – It is always a central theme in prioritizing security response. Its calculation takes into account the loss a company might suffer in the case of a successful attack. Risk helps you examine and rank vulnerabilities by the assets they affect and how those assets may interact with other business systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nContext – Not all high-value assets are externally facing and well-known. But they carry the same weight when it comes to risk. This could include a work stoppage or business downtime as the main risk. You may place more value on that asset even if it is not externally facing or otherwise well-known.\n\n\n\n\nNIST 2.0 Emphasizes Real-Time Intelligence.  Why should you also?\n\n\nWe get it. Operationalizing threat intelligence is not easy. Even worse is operationalizing something that doesn’t matter anymore.You can use threat reports to block IP addresses, and that can help but only until attackers change tactics again. Things like the MITRE ATT&CK framework can tell you about possible TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures). But they are not investigative tools that will tell you what adversary is targeting you and how to defend yourself in anticipation of an attack.\n\nThe 2.0 recommendations include many examples of the need for real-time threat intelligence to complement the capabilities of a DPRM solution. The new 2.0 standard recognizes that security analysts need to be able to observe attacker behavior and conduct a more thorough investigation. The ability to do a deeper dive into an incident requires having a view beyond your perimeter that enables analysts to make queries and quickly know the nature of an incident, including:\n\nQuickly know if a suspect IP should be further investigated\n\n  \nUnderstand what happened during an event.\n\n  \nObserve attacker behavior to anticipate an attack.\n\n  \nAttribute attackers to an incident\n\n  \nDetermine the root cause of an incident.\n\n  \nStop exfiltration by blocking c2 communications\n\n\n\n\nThese actions provide security analysts with the means to create playbooks using real-time intelligence. The data generated can also be used to identify other third parties and help compromised victims with remediation advice.  The NIST 2.0 framework is a welcomed update. Implementation examples represent a better way for companies of all sizes to consume this information and build better processes while taking advantage of new collaboration opportunities.\n\nThe NIST 2.0 Cybersecurity framework recognizes the need for more collaboration in cybersecurity.

It guides a security practitioner to identify gaps in an organization&apos;s capabilities by following the tactics a bad actor may use to gain access. It also covers the techniques employed by threat actors to move laterally inside a network and compromise additional systems and infrastructure. It sheds light on how vulnerabilities are exploited, leading threat actors to move laterally within networks. However, the framework remains static, providing a snapshot of known adversarial behavior. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>It offers security leaders and practitioners guidelines and essential attributes for threat detection, but they are not designed to guide security leaders on how to gain the visibility needed to better detect threats.  Real-time threat intelligence fills this void, providing the crucial context to attribute attacks, track adversary behavior, and map their infrastructure. It is a vital source of intelligence and visibility that extends beyond boundaries to address evolving threats. It steps in and supports rapid threat analysis by offering a dynamic view of bad actors that may be targeting you and acts as a single source of truth. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Real-time threat intelligence and the <u><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MITRE </a></u>security framework are complementary forms of intelligence that enable analysts to defend against threat actors proactively. A security framework such as MITRE is adversarial-focused. It can help you find gaps in your capabilities and give you an idea of who may be attacking you and how they move laterally within your environment to gain further access to your business systems. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Real-time intelligence gives you a way to observe the beginning stages of an attack when threat actors are performing reconnaissance on you as their target, or your third-party networks. There are few useful recommendations on how to use tools to defend an organization at this stage. But solutions do exist!  This blog seeks to discuss where, why and how these blindspots can be addressed using threat intelligence derived from external threat intelligence sources, and the strategic gains there for innovative security leaders to seize.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Real-Time External Threat Intelligence Complements the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework<span style=\"color: #b41e25;\"><strong> </strong></span></h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is renowned for its adversarial approach to defense. It provides a structured process for understanding threat actors&apos; <u><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\">tactics</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\">techniques</a></u>, and procedures (<u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/glossary-of-terms\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">TTPs</span></a></u>). It reveals their modus operandi, so analysts have a starting place to understand what tools, experience and knowledge they need to track down bad actors - both inside and beyond the perimeter. It enables security teams to fortify their defenses in the right areas and bridge capability gaps in others. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Frameworks offer guidelines and essential attributes for threat detection, but they are not designed to guide security leaders on how to gain the visibility you need to better detect threats.  Real-time threat intelligence fills this void, providing the crucial context to attribute attacks, track adversary behavior, and map their infrastructure. It is a vital source of intelligence and visibility that extends beyond boundaries to address evolving threats. It steps in and supports rapid threat analysis by offering a dynamic view of bad actors that may be targeting you and acts as a single source of truth. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The threat landscape demands innovative approaches that move beyond static data and reactive methodologies. Among the tools at a security leader&apos;s disposal are real-time threat intelligence and the <u><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a></u> framework. These two pillars of defense, though distinct in nature, can pave the way for a proactive cyber-defense strategy that enables a shift towards anticipating and defeating threats from adversaries.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>While the framework equips defenders with essential insights with a range of TTPs, you must independently learn how to create your own unique threat data and the playbooks that pivot off of it. When analysts can see infrastructure changes and trace communications with threat actor groups, they can find other victims of an attack and notify them of possible compromise. This type of threat reconnaissance is the primary way enterprise security teams can raise the cost of attack and make it less profitable for threat actors to target their organization. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Insight:</strong> Embrace both external threat intelligence and the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework to equip cyber defenders with the visibility they need. It is the cornerstone of a proactive cyber defense that does not relegate defenders to reacting to events and chasing false positives and other resource-draining efforts.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_84aacf27b3364151b3ecafc743c9f654~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Close the Capability gap for Proactive Defense with the  MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework and  Real-Time Threat Intelligence</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework lays the foundation for creating robust detection mechanisms and preparing for what can be expected to detect and mitigate a threat.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>It doesn’t take long to notice that much of the model is </strong>focused<strong> on what occurs when an attacker is already in your network - what about when they are scanning your assets? Or when they have already compromised your network and are setting up staging servers to steal your data - your internal network analysis and security tools are blind to this activity at this point in the attack so far - gaining external </strong>visibility<strong> of attacker activity is the difference of that data remaining in your possession, or being stolen.</strong></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Up-to-date external threat intelligence has the potential to greatly enhance security across the board.  By automating detection policies with data that analysts derive by tracking threat actor infrastructure, this can be applied across the entire MITRE model. i.e., before, during and after an attack. To achieve this, analysts need a real-time view of threat actor activities.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>These insights and resulting additions to defense policies mean that analysts are not providing out-of-date information to block lists, ensuring defenses are optimized and effective. They are acting on what is happening now, ensuring that any updating of defense policies uses real-time data as it develops. Access to real-time information and visibility into threat actor movements enable analysts to build constructive views and learn about IOCs from an external threat perspective. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Insight:</strong> Use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework initially as a gap analysis tool.  Not only does it call out adversary tactics, but helps to inform where you may, or may not, have visibility, tools, data, knowledge or resources that add value to your cyber defense. Allocate resources to invest in technologies that enable analysts to create actionable threat intelligence playbooks, promoting effective attribution and preventative tactics.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>How Visibility and Reconnaissance Pays off to Countering Attacks<span style=\"color: #b41e25;\"><strong> </strong></span></h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>A quick snapshot of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK reconnaissance frameworks shows ten different reconnaissance techniques and more than 30 sub-techniques that a bad actor might employ in their reconnaissance effort to gather intelligence for a targeted attack. As a defender, the framework suggestions for pre-compromise mitigations offered are minimal. Detection recommendations are relegated to anomaly-based analysis, known for high false-positive rates. It leaves little path for security leaders working towards enacting a proactive defense strategy and wanting to get ahead of attacks. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>When using threat intelligence based on internet telemetry, new possibilities open up to monitor malicious activity as it is happening.</strong></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Analysts have a ground-zero current source of truth to observe attacker behavior and quickly make decisions if a suspicious IP should be further investigated. Visibility beyond the perimeter pays off in the latter stages of attack by enabling analysts to anticipate what a threat actor is going to do next, and be able to specify proactive defenses to counter an attacks.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Creating visibility into the external threat landscape supports proactive defenses and a high detection efficacy in the pre-compromise stage. This visibility is crucial to building a proactive defense strategy and addressing all stages of compromise using the framework. </p>\n<p>Aggressive efforts made in the pre-compromise stage of an attack can pay out benefits towards prevention during exfiltration. Suppose you use internet telemetry enriched with threat intelligence for visibility and reconnaissance in the pre-compromise stage. In that case, you already have the answers to block exfiltration proactively instead of relying on signature or anomaly-based detection methods. It is a better way to address threats than using reactionary methods that lead to high false positive rates. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Insight:</strong> Identify your visibility gaps that lie within the  ‘Reconnaissance’ column of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework.   This will lead to data sources that will help you to better understand the threat actors that are reaching out to your own and third-party networks, including victims of ongoing attacks. It reveals their evolving tactics, and the changes they make to their infrastructure before another attack.  External threat intelligence or internet telemetry are the only sources of knowledge and data that will fill the visibility gap for threat actors at the Reconnaissance stage of the model.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Enhance Detection Capabilities with Actionable Insights</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Real-time up-to-date external threat intelligence derived from internet telemetry has the potential to greatly enhance security across the board.  By automating detection policies with data that analysts derive by tracking threat actor infrastructure, it can be applied across the entire MITRE model. i.e., before, during and after an attack. To achieve this, analysts need to be able to observe attackers in real time view of threat actor activities.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>These insights and resulting additions to defense policies mean that analysts are not providing out-of-date information to block lists, ensuring defenses are optimized and effective with current information. They are acting on what is happening now, ensuring that any updating of defense policies uses real-time data as it develops. Access to real-time information and visibility into threat actor movements enable analysts to build constructive views and learn about IOCs from an external threat perspective. It&apos;s important to remember that the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework does not provide a complete answer to defense against attackers&apos; tactics, techniques, and procedures and only offers suggestions for mitigation and detection.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Leverage Internet Telemetry & Threat Intelligence for Benefits Beyond the MITRE ATT&CK Framework \n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework is like a blueprint of the battlefield, showcasing potential threat actors and their tactics to infiltrate an organization. It guides a security practitioner to identify gaps in an organization's capabilities by following the tactics a bad actor may use to gain access. It also covers the techniques employed by threat actors to move laterally inside a network and compromise additional systems and infrastructure. It sheds light on how vulnerabilities are exploited, leading threat actors to move laterally within networks. However, the framework remains static, providing a snapshot of known adversarial behavior. \n\nIt offers security leaders and practitioners guidelines and essential attributes for threat detection, but they are not designed to guide security leaders on how to gain the visibility needed to better detect threats.  Real-time threat intelligence fills this void, providing the crucial context to attribute attacks, track adversary behavior, and map their infrastructure. It is a vital source of intelligence and visibility that extends beyond boundaries to address evolving threats. It steps in and supports rapid threat analysis by offering a dynamic view of bad actors that may be targeting you and acts as a single source of truth. \n\nReal-time threat intelligence and the MITRE security framework are complementary forms of intelligence that enable analysts to defend against threat actors proactively. A security framework such as MITRE is adversarial-focused. It can help you find gaps in your capabilities and give you an idea of who may be attacking you and how they move laterally within your environment to gain further access to your business systems. \n\nReal-time intelligence gives you a way to observe the beginning stages of an attack when threat actors are performing reconnaissance on you as their target, or your third-party networks. There are few useful recommendations on how to use tools to defend an organization at this stage. But solutions do exist!  This blog seeks to discuss where, why and how these blindspots can be addressed using threat intelligence derived from external threat intelligence sources, and the strategic gains there for innovative security leaders to seize.\n\nReal-Time External Threat Intelligence Complements the MITRE ATT&CK Framework \n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework is renowned for its adversarial approach to defense. It provides a structured process for understanding threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It reveals their modus operandi, so analysts have a starting place to understand what tools, experience and knowledge they need to track down bad actors - both inside and beyond the perimeter. It enables security teams to fortify their defenses in the right areas and bridge capability gaps in others. \n\nFrameworks offer guidelines and essential attributes for threat detection, but they are not designed to guide security leaders on how to gain the visibility you need to better detect threats.  Real-time threat intelligence fills this void, providing the crucial context to attribute attacks, track adversary behavior, and map their infrastructure. It is a vital source of intelligence and visibility that extends beyond boundaries to address evolving threats. It steps in and supports rapid threat analysis by offering a dynamic view of bad actors that may be targeting you and acts as a single source of truth. \n\nThe threat landscape demands innovative approaches that move beyond static data and reactive methodologies. Among the tools at a security leader's disposal are real-time threat intelligence and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. These two pillars of defense, though distinct in nature, can pave the way for a proactive cyber-defense strategy that enables a shift towards anticipating and defeating threats from adversaries.\n\nWhile the framework equips defenders with essential insights with a range of TTPs, you must independently learn how to create your own unique threat data and the playbooks that pivot off of it. When analysts can see infrastructure changes and trace communications with threat actor groups, they can find other victims of an attack and notify them of possible compromise. This type of threat reconnaissance is the primary way enterprise security teams can raise the cost of attack and make it less profitable for threat actors to target their organization. \n\nActionable Insight: Embrace both external threat intelligence and the MITRE ATT&CK framework to equip cyber defenders with the visibility they need. It is the cornerstone of a proactive cyber defense that does not relegate defenders to reacting to events and chasing false positives and other resource-draining efforts.\n\n\n\nClose the Capability gap for Proactive Defense with the  MITRE ATT&CK Framework and  Real-Time Threat Intelligence\n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework lays the foundation for creating robust detection mechanisms and preparing for what can be expected to detect and mitigate a threat.\n\nIt doesn’t take long to notice that much of the model is focused on what occurs when an attacker is already in your network - what about when they are scanning your assets? Or when they have already compromised your network and are setting up staging servers to steal your data - your internal network analysis and security tools are blind to this activity at this point in the attack so far - gaining external visibility of attacker activity is the difference of that data remaining in your possession, or being stolen.\n\nUp-to-date external threat intelligence has the potential to greatly enhance security across the board.  By automating detection policies with data that analysts derive by tracking threat actor infrastructure, this can be applied across the entire MITRE model. i.e., before, during and after an attack. To achieve this, analysts need a real-time view of threat actor activities.\n\nThese insights and resulting additions to defense policies mean that analysts are not providing out-of-date information to block lists, ensuring defenses are optimized and effective. They are acting on what is happening now, ensuring that any updating of defense policies uses real-time data as it develops. Access to real-time information and visibility into threat actor movements enable analysts to build constructive views and learn about IOCs from an external threat perspective. \n\nActionable Insight: Use the MITRE ATT&CK framework initially as a gap analysis tool.  Not only does it call out adversary tactics, but helps to inform where you may, or may not, have visibility, tools, data, knowledge or resources that add value to your cyber defense. Allocate resources to invest in technologies that enable analysts to create actionable threat intelligence playbooks, promoting effective attribution and preventative tactics.\n\nHow Visibility and Reconnaissance Pays off to Countering Attacks \n\nA quick snapshot of the MITRE ATT&CK reconnaissance frameworks shows ten different reconnaissance techniques and more than 30 sub-techniques that a bad actor might employ in their reconnaissance effort to gather intelligence for a targeted attack. As a defender, the framework suggestions for pre-compromise mitigations offered are minimal. Detection recommendations are relegated to anomaly-based analysis, known for high false-positive rates. It leaves little path for security leaders working towards enacting a proactive defense strategy and wanting to get ahead of attacks. \n\nWhen using threat intelligence based on internet telemetry, new possibilities open up to monitor malicious activity as it is happening.\n\nAnalysts have a ground-zero current source of truth to observe attacker behavior and quickly make decisions if a suspicious IP should be further investigated. Visibility beyond the perimeter pays off in the latter stages of attack by enabling analysts to anticipate what a threat actor is going to do next, and be able to specify proactive defenses to counter an attacks.\n\nCreating visibility into the external threat landscape supports proactive defenses and a high detection efficacy in the pre-compromise stage. This visibility is crucial to building a proactive defense strategy and addressing all stages of compromise using the framework. \nAggressive efforts made in the pre-compromise stage of an attack can pay out benefits towards prevention during exfiltration. Suppose you use internet telemetry enriched with threat intelligence for visibility and reconnaissance in the pre-compromise stage. In that case, you already have the answers to block exfiltration proactively instead of relying on signature or anomaly-based detection methods. It is a better way to address threats than using reactionary methods that lead to high false positive rates. \n\nActionable Insight: Identify your visibility gaps that lie within the  ‘Reconnaissance’ column of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.   This will lead to data sources that will help you to better understand the threat actors that are reaching out to your own and third-party networks, including victims of ongoing attacks. It reveals their evolving tactics, and the changes they make to their infrastructure before another attack.  External threat intelligence or internet telemetry are the only sources of knowledge and data that will fill the visibility gap for threat actors at the Reconnaissance stage of the model.\n\nEnhance Detection Capabilities with Actionable Insights\n\nReal-time up-to-date external threat intelligence derived from internet telemetry has the potential to greatly enhance security across the board.  By automating detection policies with data that analysts derive by tracking threat actor infrastructure, it can be applied across the entire MITRE model. i.e., before, during and after an attack. To achieve this, analysts need to be able to observe attackers in real time view of threat actor activities.\n\nThese insights and resulting additions to defense policies mean that analysts are not providing out-of-date information to block lists, ensuring defenses are optimized and effective with current information. They are acting on what is happening now, ensuring that any updating of defense policies uses real-time data as it develops. Access to real-time information and visibility into threat actor movements enable analysts to build constructive views and learn about IOCs from an external threat perspective. It's important to remember that the MITRE ATT&CK framework does not provide a complete answer to defense against attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures and only offers suggestions for mitigation and detection. Bad actors constantly innovate, and a security leader's response must do the same.\n\nLet your analysts do more by tracing down attackers, making associations, and preempting an attack with reconnaissance-led intelligence that can actively block an attack. Once you enable visibility to internet telemetry and historical context, analysts are not just reacting to what is happening inside the network.

It&apos;s vital in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and protecting digital assets from malicious actors. Integrating threat modeling into corporate initiatives early in development lays a secure foundation for product enhancements. Cyber threat modeling complements many different business initiatives and scenarios. Its versatility makes it applicable to a wide range of business initiatives,  including:</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Application Development and Design</strong>: Early-stage software and app development to pinpoint design, architecture, and code vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Critical Network Infrastructure</strong>: Assessing routers, firewalls, and switches to identify attack vectors and improve network security.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Cloud and Virtualization</strong>: Understand the security implications of cloud and virtualization technologies and manage risks.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>IoT Devices</strong>: A vital component of secure IoT device design and communication protocols, especially in medical settings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Critical Infrastructure</strong>:  Digital transformation projects create risks that need threat modeling to build defenses for anticipating cyber threats.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>E-commerce and Finance</strong>: Online platforms handling online transactions and customer incentives need to build defenses against attacks that take into account seasonal impacts and changes to incentives and fulfillment partners.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Healthcare and Medical Devices</strong>: Connected patient healthcare and communications must be protected with built-in defenses. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Automotive and Transportation</strong>: Development of embedded defenses for secure connected vehicles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Supply Chain Security</strong>: Assess security risks with threat models that include software supply chain partners used to deliver services and operate critical production systems and communications.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Incident Response</strong>: Simulate cyberattacks with threat modeling to develop response plans.</p>\n<p>Government and Defense: Capture nation-state actors <u><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Tactics_Techniques_and_Procedures\" target=\"_blank\">TTPs</a></u> to build predictive defenses and proactive response.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Social Engineering</strong>: Improve awareness against social engineering cyber-attacks with threat models that visualizes a credential based compromise.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>All of these will likely have internet facing systems, or communications that traverse it, making external threat intelligence a key ingredient for their success and security.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Create Preemptive Defenses using Frameworks and Threat Models</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Security practitioners within enterprise organizations use tools, methodologies, and frameworks for comprehensive threat modeling. PASTA and STRIDE methodologies and OWASP and MITRE ATT&amp;CK frameworks offer different approaches to modeling threat actor behavior and their techniques, tactics, and procedures. On the defensive side, many tactical workflows and processes use frameworks to anticipate attacks and devise built-in resiliency in case of compromise. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Frameworks like <u><a href=\"https://owasp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OWASP</a></u> (Open Web Application Security Project) and <u><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a></u> (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) provide resources for analysts to build a threat modeling practice.

Our own <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/visualizing-qakbot-infrastructure-part-ii-uncharted-territory\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">research</span></a></u> demonstrates that even your cyber adversaries have seasonal changes that impact when they are most likely to launch an attack against your organization.  Business unit leaders play a pivotal role in these scenarios, as their insights can help align threat models with evolving commercial dynamics.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Establishing a feedback loop between threat modeling, intelligence, hunting teams, and business units is instrumental in assessing ongoing application changes and the internal and external threat landscape. For instance, integrating third-party access via APIs or introducing new monetization strategies can dramatically alter an application&apos;s threat model by introducing new threat vectors. This adaptability ensures that threat models remain relevant and effective in the face of emerging challenges.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Build Threat Models that include Partners and Cloud Services </h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Business transformation initiatives are a driving force in migrating to cloud services to speed up the launch of new applications and customer services. Third-party services available through APIs are another factor that spurs the adoption of cloud services and drives the availability of online customer services. Proactive defense of core applications critical to the business requires continuous monitoring and prioritization of CVEs, especially within vulnerable application development frameworks. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Organizations must enact proactive security measures that allow analysts to quickly discover new applications, points of entry, and how new business partnerships will change their attack surface and influence business risk. This is critical in light of the software supply chain that makes up online customer services or other core functions you cannot do without. </p>\n<p>When analysts can operate with an outside-in view of your external attack surface that includes third parties and cloud services, they can better defend it.This level of visibility enables the creation of realistic threat models that consider third parties that support your applications. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>As cybersecurity threats evolve, threat modeling emerges as an indispensable tool for organizations making strides toward a proactive security defense. Early examination of potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities using threat models empowers security practitioners to craft aggressive defenses in designing new services and products. By integrating threat intelligence and fostering collaboration across various teams, organizations can ensure their threat models remain relevant, agile, and capable of anticipating and mitigating emerging threats. The synergy between threat modeling, intelligence, and stakeholder involvement paves the way for a more secure and resilient digital future.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Further Reading:</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Learn more about the threat vectors you should be considering in your Threat Model <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/threat-vectors\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></u></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Read our <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/gate/case-study-what-elite-threat-hunters-see-that-others-cant\" target=\"_blank\">customer case study</a></u> about the discoveries made when external Threat Intelligence is applied over a Threat Model. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/threat-intelligence-a-ciso-roi-guide-elite-threat-hunters-prevent-supply-chain-breaches\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Up the Ante on Supply Chain Security </span></a></u></p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/threat-intelligence-a-ciso-roi-guide-focus-on-real-time-threat-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Stop the Budget Drain of Dated Threat Intelligence</span></a></u></p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/threat-intelligence-a-ciso-s-roi-avoid-inheriting-a-security-problem-with-m-a-acquisitions\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Don’t Inherit a Security Problem with M&amp;A Activity</span></a></u></p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/threat-intelligence-a-ciso-roi-guide-automate-to-increase-productivity\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Automate Real-Time Intelligence and Increase Productivity. and Morale!</span></a></u></p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/threat-intelligence-a-ciso-roi-guide-prevent-data-breaches\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">External Threat Hunting Prevents Data Breaches</span></a></u></p>\n<p><br /></p>",

Business unit leaders play a pivotal role in these scenarios, as their insights can help align threat models with evolving commercial dynamics.\n\nEstablishing a feedback loop between threat modeling, intelligence, hunting teams, and business units is instrumental in assessing ongoing application changes and the internal and external threat landscape. For instance, integrating third-party access via APIs or introducing new monetization strategies can dramatically alter an application's threat model by introducing new threat vectors. This adaptability ensures that threat models remain relevant and effective in the face of emerging challenges.\n\nBuild Threat Models that include Partners and Cloud Services \n\nBusiness transformation initiatives are a driving force in migrating to cloud services to speed up the launch of new applications and customer services. Third-party services available through APIs are another factor that spurs the adoption of cloud services and drives the availability of online customer services. Proactive defense of core applications critical to the business requires continuous monitoring and prioritization of CVEs, especially within vulnerable application development frameworks. \n\nOrganizations must enact proactive security measures that allow analysts to quickly discover new applications, points of entry, and how new business partnerships will change their attack surface and influence business risk. This is critical in light of the software supply chain that makes up online customer services or other core functions you cannot do without. \nWhen analysts can operate with an outside-in view of your external attack surface that includes third parties and cloud services, they can better defend it.This level of visibility enables the creation of realistic threat models that consider third parties that support your applications. \n\nAs cybersecurity threats evolve, threat modeling emerges as an indispensable tool for organizations making strides toward a proactive security defense. Early examination of potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities using threat models empowers security practitioners to craft aggressive defenses in designing new services and products. By integrating threat intelligence and fostering collaboration across various teams, organizations can ensure their threat models remain relevant, agile, and capable of anticipating and mitigating emerging threats. The synergy between threat modeling, intelligence, and stakeholder involvement paves the way for a more secure and resilient digital future.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nLearn more about the threat vectors you should be considering in your Threat Model here\n\nRead our customer case study about the discoveries made when external Threat Intelligence is applied over a Threat Model. \n\nUp the Ante on Supply Chain Security \nStop the Budget Drain of Dated Threat Intelligence\nDon’t Inherit a Security Problem with M&A Activity\nAutomate Real-Time Intelligence and Increase Productivity. and Morale!\nExternal Threat Hunting Prevents Data Breaches",

We will pick up the timeline from where we left it, basing our findings on data collected between 1 May and 20 July 2023.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We have continued to focus on elements and trends for which we do not observe in regular commentary; specifically the relationship between victim-facing command and control (C2) infrastructure and upstream servers, we previously referenced these as being geolocated in Russia.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>As with our previous blog, this represents an ongoing piece of research, our analysis of QakBot is fluid with various hypotheses being identified and tested. As and when we uncover new insights into QakBot campaigns we will seek to provide further written updates. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>We welcome feedback and comment via our </strong><u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/teamcymru_S2\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\"><strong>Twitter</strong></span></a></u><strong> page on the hypotheses mentioned in this post; broadly our findings represent the benefits and challenges of working with NetFlow data - whilst we can form broad conclusions, these are sometimes open to interpretation. Confirmation and contradiction are both of value to us as we continue to understand this threat operation.</strong></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>C2 activity around both victim and upstream T2 communication slowed down before spamming ended around 22 June. After spamming ceased, C2 activity continued albeit at a lower volume.</p></li>\n  <li><p>15 new C2s set up after spamming ended have been identified so far. Additionally, the number of existing C2s communicating with the T2 layer significantly decreased with only 8 remaining past 22 June.</p></li>\n  <li><p>We’ve observed interesting outbound activity from the T2 layer, targeting both publicly reported and suspected Qakbot C2s, as well as other undefined destinations. </p><ul>\n  <li><p>The T2 C2s connect to the same list of ports used in the process for deploying the Qakbot proxy module, with usually only one or two ports observed in a day.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Although the volume of connections, variety of destinations, and port usage appear random, over time the destination ports are used with relatively equal frequency.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n  <li><p>During the first half of 2023, port 443 was assigned to approximately 48% of the C2s extracted from Qakbot campaigns. Among those C2s, only a subset engaged in communication with the T2 layer. Within this subset, 80% were assigned port 443, making it the predominant port for communication between victims and C2s.</p></li>\n  <li><p>C2s are usually compromised hosts in residential IPs space, as are the other destination IPs identified from outbound T2 connections. Additional criteria like geolocation and AS organization may influence the selection of these hosts, guiding the purchase from third parties and determining which Qakbot victims become bot C2s or used for other operator activity.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Summer Glow Up</h2>\n<p>Qakbot has a history of taking an extended break each summer before returning sometime in September, with this year&apos;s spamming activities ceasing around 22 June 2023. But are the QakBot operators actually on vacation when they aren’t spamming, or is this &quot;break&quot; a time for them to refine and update their infrastructure and tools? It&apos;s worth considering that the summer months might offer a unique opportunity for operational work, especially when their main targets in the Northern Hemisphere are often on some form of holiday, leading to a potential decline in the success rate of their attacks during this time.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The line graph below shows the volume of connections from C2s over TCP/443 to the three Tier 2 (T2) IPs geolocated in Russia.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In our previous blog post, we referred to the three T2s as RU1, RU2, and RU3. Since then, the IPs have been made public so we have included them in some of the legends accompanying the charts below. However, for the sake of simplicity and continuity, we will continue to refer to them collectively as RU* within this post.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_f26028516754401aa4115937586ce5c9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Volume of bot C2s connections with the T2 layer (RU1, RU2, RU3) over TCP/443</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>After a very busy May, things began to slowly wind down at the end of the month before a sudden drop in connections to the T2 in early June, even though spamming continued for three more weeks until around 22 June. We were unable to identify any new T2s after this decline in activity, though traffic from some C2s persisted, suggesting that the T2 infrastructure remained unchanged. However, it wouldn’t be surprising if fresh IPs for the T2 layer are introduced before their anticipated return in late summer.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>After this drop-off, a slight spike was observed on 21 and 22 June, the last day of pre-summer mass spamming (affiliate ID obama271). Interestingly, a few more spikes occurred after this period, which we will explore further. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The graph below represents the volume of bot C2 to T2 traffic according to C2 geolocation:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_5e38008fe6d54a32ae34ebd9be5db10c~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Volume of bot C2 to T2 traffic per geolocation (of C2s) for 1 May through 20 July</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>From this perspective, we observe that on 2 June, US C2s all but disappeared, and traffic from Indian C2s significantly decreased. We suspect the lack of US activity is at least partially attributable to Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs null-routing the T2 layer in their networks, as noted in their <u><a href=\"https://blog.lumen.com/qakbot-retool-reinfect-recycle/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">recent blog post</span></a></u>. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>For curiosity’s sake, let&apos;s quickly examine data for traffic volume and timing from the perspective of likely QakBot victim to C2 communications during the same time frame:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_353006379a23480f8c6ff614fb6ba687~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: Volume of inbound connections to C2s from hosts that are likely infected with Qakbot</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>As was the case with C2 to T2 communications, we can see a winding down of activity at the end of May, however this does not drop off as suddenly at the beginning of June. Instead, victim to C2 communications appear to gradually reduce in volume up to and beyond the date QakBot ceased spamming operations (22 June).</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Turning back to C2 to T2 activity, the following graph is a zoomed-in view of June onward, highlighting the start of a considerable drop in activity that persists through July.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_94c60832a91749c6bea8be2eb788c4a6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Volume of bot C2 to T2 traffic per geolocation (of C2s) for 1 June through 20 July</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>According to our data, a lull lasted from 2 June to 12 June, during which only Indian C2s communicated upstream, albeit at a drastically reduced volume compared to May. We also noted some spikes in traffic from South African C2s.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We examined the IPs from the geolocations present during this timeframe to determine whether these were legacy C2s with sporadic bursts of activity, or new C2s being incorporated into their infrastructure. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Our analysis revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Fifteen new C2s were set up since Qakbot ceased spamming, indicated by a green box in the timeline below.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Six additional C2s, active since before June (some dating back to October and December 2022), that continued to exhibit upstream activity after spamming concluded, indicated by a blue box in the timeline below.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Two C2s, new in June, that also maintained activity after spamming concluded, indicated by an orange box in the timeline below.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_c918e62c2a8b40e6915530ce957c7857~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_637,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 5: Timeline of most recent reported and suspected Qakbot C2s</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We suspect that the IPs in the above timeline represent new and existing C2s intended for use upon Qakbot’s return post-summer glow up break. Most of the C2s established after spamming ceased have only a few connections to the T2 and for brief durations, possibly indicative of C2s that are not currently active but were prepared or primed for future spamming.<span style=\"color: #9900ff;\"> </span></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We will continue monitoring Qakbot during their summer break for any signs of changes in their infrastructure or how they operate.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>The Mystery of the Outbound Tier 2 Connections</h2>\n<p>Whilst examining NetFlow data for the C2 to T2 communications from which we derived the findings described above, we kept making the same unexpected observation. A clear pattern of communications sourced from the T2s, where QakBot C2s were the destination, i.e., the reverse of the traffic we were examining. These communications occurred over the same 32 ports: 20, 21, 22, 53, 80, 443, 465, 990, 993, 995, 1194, 2078, 2083, 2087, 2222, 3389, 6881, 6882, 6883, 8443, 32100, 32101, 32102, 32103, 50000, 50001, 50002, 50003, 50010, 61200, 61201, and 61202.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Malware such as Qakbot, IcedID, and Emotet leverage tiered infrastructure. This consists of victim hosts communicating with bot C2s, which comprise the Tier 1 layer of the bot infrastructure, which then communicate upstream with the T2 layer. The traffic typically continues to be proxied through additional tiers of infrastructure before it reaches the pane, which is accessed by the threat actors. Aside from subtle differences, for example the ports used, this process is essentially the same for the many malware families we track. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The traffic we have observed sourced <u>from</u> QakBot T2s to the C2 / Tier 1 layer is atypical. When we expand our dataset to look at all outbound traffic from the T2s, we establish a larger pool of ‘T2 destination IPs’. As mentioned, some of these T2 destination IPs are publicly reported QakBot C2s. However, in the majority of cases the T2 destination IPs have not previously been identified as malicious, although many share common host characteristics associated with QakBot C2s.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_faa4fa5ed55f4ad28c513921888db411~mv2.gif/v1/fit/w_400,h_240,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p>Let’s begin by examining what we already know. Qakbot C2s utilize various ports as defined in their malware configurations. These are the ports that an infected host would use to communicate with the bot C2. Bot C2s are generally compromised machines, often including previous Qakbot victims that have been elevated to C2 status. Our findings for 2023 reveal that 52 different ports were employed for C2s within the Qakbot configurations, including many of the ports listed above. Based on this, it is possible that the T2s are conducting a form of check-in with the C2s, utilizing the ports designated for victim traffic. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We developed a second theory based on information provided in a fantastic writeup published a few years ago by <u><a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/exploring-qbots-latest-attack-methods\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Check Point Research</span></a></u>, where they explored how a Qakbot-infected victim ultimately receives the proxy module. After the malware ensures incoming connections are allowed in the host firewall and port forwarding is enabled, it verifies incoming connections by sending a message to a bot, with confirmation based upon the response. The payload in this message contains a list of ports that match the same destination ports the T2s are using for the mysterious outbound connections, as shown in the excerpt below.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_549ec254749a4ac68a4383cf4afa3692~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_186,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 6: “An Old Bot’s Nasty New Tricks: Exploring Qbot’s Latest Attack Methods“, Check Point Research, 2020</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Mystery solved? Unfortunately no, it wasn’t so simple. The activity that Check Point describes would appear differently in NetFlow data from what we are currently observing with respect to outbound T2 communications. Our investigation encompasses repeated connections over an extended time frame, interspersed with periods of inactivity. Usually, one to three of the T2s will sporadically reach out to the same destination IPs for months, and not in a manner that implies verification of a fixed list of available ports.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>However, this information offers another possible explanation for the activity; the mysterious outbound connections from the T2s might be related in some way to the proxy module, given the identical port list. Spoiler alert, we believe this the most likely theory based on our analysis of the NetFlow data and information currently available to us, into which we will now delve deeper.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #b41e25;\">“You know my method.

The unreported C2s were identified by monitoring communications to the T2s over TCP/443 during the same time period.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_96d90c4967364c4995e5e8cd9be50d28~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 7: Percentages of T2 destination IPs that are Qakbot C2s, and of IPs with upstream T2 bot communication</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Repeating the same process for analyzing bot C2 to T2 NetFlow data, we found that <strong>76%</strong> of all source IPs were recognized as Qakbot C2s.

Consequently, over <strong>70%</strong> of the T2 destination IPs have <em>not</em> been observed in the wild as malicious. Furthermore, only <strong>12%</strong> of the T2 destination IPs displayed upstream T2 bot traffic typical of a normal C2 but were not identified in the wild as Qakbot C2s. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Based on these discrepancies, it seems improbable that the T2s are conducting any sort of management-related check-in for the bot C2s. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #b41e25;\">NetFlow Observations II: Traffic Volume</span></h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_7a26fae1d98a441ea110f40b80f8ab0f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 9: Line chart of traffic volume for outbound communication per T2 C2, spike outliers are cut off for legibility</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Similar to the upstream bot C2 traffic we analyzed in our previous blog post, there are notable resemblances between <strong>RU2</strong> and <strong>RU3</strong> in terms of traffic volume and timing, and are also adjacent IP addresses associated with<span style=\"color: #333333;\"> </span>Horizon LLC (ASN 59425). In contrast, <strong>RU1</strong> belongs to IP space assigned to SmartApe (ASN 56694), and exhibits a lower overall traffic volume compared to the other two IPs.

Although there is minimal overlap between the groups of bot C2s and T2 destination IPs, it seems that both forms of T2 activity occur in a sequential manner, contingent on traffic volume. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b41e25;\">NetFlow Observations III: Port Usage Frequency </span></p>\n<p>In Qakbot C2 configurations, many C2s (often exceeding 100) are present, but only a small subset have been observed communicating with the T2 layer in our data. Taking into account all C2s, regardless of T2 communication, we found that approximately 48% were assigned port 443, 29% port 2222, and 16% port 995. All other ports were allocated to fewer than 3% of C2s.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that for C2s we’ve identified communicating upstream over TCP/443, these percentages change; around 80% of C2s are assigned port 443, 9% port 995, 5% port 2078, and 4% port 2222. The remaining ports were associated with less than 1% of C2s. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In comparison, the chart below illustrates the frequency of destination ports utilized for outbound connections from the T2:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_ff68c66c23d7421d8f37db231790bb61~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_772,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p>Figure 12: Frequency of ports used as destination ports in outbound T2 connections, since November 2022</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Upon examination, it’s immediately evident that there is no correlation between the two datasets regarding port usage frequency. Although port 443 was technically the most frequently utilized destination port for outbound T2 connections, its usage is far from the 48% seen with all reported bot C2s (regardless of T2 communication), and port 3389 was observed just as often. In fact, all of the 32 ports we identified with this type of communication were seen at roughly equivalent rates, with port 21 being the least common. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>On its own, this data point might suggest some form of automation governing which ports are accessed. However, this inference alone is not sufficient.

By viewing the visuals collectively, it&apos;s apparent that typically only a small number of ports are accessed in a single day, with usually just one or two destination IPs accessed via each port (y-axis). Interestingly, all of the T2 IPs have visually different patterns from this perspective, a finding that contradicts the general similarities observed between <strong>RU2</strong> and <strong>RU3</strong>. However, <strong>RU2</strong> and <strong>RU3</strong> do share a similar volume of ports seen per day compared to <strong>RU1</strong>.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Despite these variations, there are common patterns that all three hosts exhibit. For example, they all display consistent periods of inactivity, such as those occurring from May 1-2, June 4-6, and June 9-13. They also share some spikes related to the variety of different ports used for outbound connections within specific time frames, as seen on 8 June and the period around 14/15 June. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>So far, we’ve determined that the T2 makes outbound connections over different ports at relatively the same frequency, with no one or two ports used far more or less than others. However, usually, only a few of the ports are seen in connections per day, and they seem to be chosen sporadically, with the exception of certain days when almost all of the ports are utilized. Regardless, over time, the T2s communicate across each of the 32 ports with a generally equal frequency.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>What remains unclear is the rhythm or cadence of how often a T2 connects to each destination IP using these ports, and whether this process is automated. If blatant automation is involved, we would anticipate a pattern of repeated connections with consistent timing and volume. Behavior attributed to human intervention wouldn&apos;t be so orderly; instead, it would appear more random and unpredictable. While automation can be configured to mimic this, we can at least rule out the more evident instances.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>To delve deeper, we chose a small sample of IPs that showed inbound T2 connections over an extended period and mapped out a timeline. In this illustration, each line color symbolizes a different T2 destination IP from the sample. A spike in a line indicates that at least one of the T2 C2s connected to that IP on that day, with the Y axis representing how many of the 32 destination ports were observed in those communications.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_5dc169f432e849598b70ca88cbb9d89e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 16: Volume and timing of inbound connections from the T2 for a sample of nine destination IPs</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Examining the timing and volume of connections for each destination IP, there appears to be no evident pattern suggesting the use of automation. The T2 C2s communicate with these IPs erratically and in inconsistent volumes. While it&apos;s conceivable that the activity is directly linked to operator actions, considering the observations previously discussed, it may actually be a hybrid of both systematic automation and random activity. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We hypothesize that the selection of ports used in connections may be determined by an automated process, yet the connections themselves seem to be responsive to the unpredictable nature of C2 bot communications that outbound T2 connections appear to follow.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #b41e25;\">NetFlow Observations IV: Characteristics of Destination IPs </span></h2>\n<p>To enrich our analysis, we examined and compared characteristics such as AS and geolocation to those of hosts identified from typical upstream bot communication. Some T2 destination IPs were confirmed as proxies and subsequently removed from the data to prevent skewing observations based on specific host details.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We first compared geolocations between T2 destination IPs and bot C2s identified from November to July 2023. We identified geolocations that were unique to bot C2s and not present among T2 destination IPs. Geolocations that were shared between the two datasets appeared in differing quantities. For instance, while only 31% of bot C2s were situated in the US, this figure increased to 60% of T2 destination IPs. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_548aa112b4f945c2919047d2bef7247b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 17: Side-by-side comparison of the geolocations that are associated bot C2s and T2 destination IPs</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Next, we made a similar comparison of AS designations, filtered by geolocations with more than one IP. As pointed out by Black Lotus Labs, Qakbot seems to favor compromised hosts located in residential IP space, and our findings align with this observation. We found that Comcast is the predominant AS organization for both bot C2s and T2 destination IPs. According to our NetFlow data, the vast majority of US-based T2 destination IPs and (high confidence) bot C2s with upstream T2 connections are located within Comcast’s IP space. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_c3d9bd836c1148fc96b8371962238a7d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_1000,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p>Figure 18: Side-by-side comparison of AS organizations associated with bot C2s and T2 destination IPs.

These factors could determine which hosts are purchased from third parties, or decide which Qakbot victims are escalated to the status of bot C2s or become T2 destination IPs, at least in some cases.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In this post, we have sought to continue our understanding of the relationship between the various tiers of infrastructure associated with the QakBot operation. Our data illustrates the winding down of operations leading up to QakBot’s seasonal ‘lull’ in operations, which appears in part to have been accelerated by good work from Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs. However, we also demonstrate that there is not a total cessation in operations, new infrastructure continues to be stood up albeit at a reduced cadence - likely for future use once spamming recommences.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We have also sought to illuminate interesting communications sourced from QakBot’s upstream infrastructure, with outbound traffic occurring to both reported and unreported QakBot C2s, as well as currently undefined servers. We have demonstrated possible relationships between this activity and inbound communications to the same upstream infrastructure, noting that activity does not overlap, but one may precede the other.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We have established an interest in 32 specific ports, which the upstream infrastructure seeks to communicate with, potentially associated with QakBot’s proxy module. We have also shown that this activity is, at least in part, possibly human-generated, with some reliance on automation for certain elements of the activity (specifying ports).</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Finally, we hypothesized that certain factors may be considered when elevating a victim / compromised host to C2 status; including geolocation and who the host is assigned to from a hosting perspective.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Drawing this all together, we hope to have provided some interesting leads into further investigation of the QakBot operation, as well as providing opportunities for identification and mitigation of its threat. In elevating victims to be used as C2 infrastructure with T2 communication, QakBot effectively punishes users twice, first in the initial compromise, and second in the potential risk to reputation of a host being identified publicly as malicious. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We believe cutting off communications to the upstream servers is an effective remedy to the second part of this process; meaning that victim machines are cut off from further C2 instructions and in doing so protecting current and future users from compromise.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Users of Pure Signal Recon and Scout are able to follow this activity by querying for the three Russian T2 IPs.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Cyber defenders should monitor for inbound connections from the three Russian T2 IPs over the ports listed below. </p></li>\n  <li><p>In addition, to identify any compromised hosts that were elevated to Qakbot C2 status, monitor for outbound connections from the host to any of the T2 IPs over TCP/443.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<h5>Ports</h5>\n<p>20 </p>\n<p>21 </p>\n<p>22 </p>\n<p>53 </p>\n<p>80 </p>\n<p>443 </p>\n<p>465 </p>\n<p>990 </p>\n<p>993 </p>\n<p>995 </p>\n<p>1194 </p>\n<p>2078 </p>\n<p>2083 </p>\n<p>2087 </p>\n<p>2222 </p>\n<p>3389 </p>\n<p>6881 </p>\n<p>6882 </p>\n<p>6883 </p>\n<p>8443 </p>\n<p>32100 </p>\n<p>32101 </p>\n<p>32102 </p>\n<p>32103 </p>\n<p>50000 </p>\n<p>50001 </p>\n<p>50002 </p>\n<p>50003 </p>\n<p>50010 </p>\n<p>61200 </p>\n<p>61201 </p>\n<p>61202</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h5>RU T2</h5>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">188.127.231.177</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">62.204.41.187</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">62.204.41.188</span></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b41e25;\">New Bot C2s (Figure 5)</span></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>73.32.187.91 </p>\n<p>81.20.248.72 </p>\n<p>103.107.36.56 </p>\n<p>113.193.95.44 </p>\n<p>113.193.166.238 </p>\n<p>180.151.16.132 </p>\n<p>197.86.195.132 </p>\n<p>197.87.63.16 </p>\n<p>197.87.135.186 </p>\n<p>197.87.135.218 </p>\n<p>197.87.143.152 </p>\n<p>197.87.143.229 </p>\n<p>197.89.10.173 </p>\n<p>197.92.136.237 </p>\n<p>201.130.167.212</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b41e25;\">Other C2s Observed Active January -

      "content:encodedSnippet": "A Data-Driven Approach Based on Analysis of Network Telemetry\n\nIn this blog post, we will provide an update on our high-level analysis of QakBot infrastructure, following on from our previous blog post. We will pick up the timeline from where we left it, basing our findings on data collected between 1 May and 20 July 2023.\n\nWe have continued to focus on elements and trends for which we do not observe in regular commentary; specifically the relationship between victim-facing command and control (C2) infrastructure and upstream servers, we previously referenced these as being geolocated in Russia.\n\nAs with our previous blog, this represents an ongoing piece of research, our analysis of QakBot is fluid with various hypotheses being identified and tested. As and when we uncover new insights into QakBot campaigns we will seek to provide further written updates. \n\nWe welcome feedback and comment via our Twitter page on the hypotheses mentioned in this post; broadly our findings represent the benefits and challenges of working with NetFlow data - whilst we can form broad conclusions, these are sometimes open to interpretation. Confirmation and contradiction are both of value to us as we continue to understand this threat operation.\n\nKey Findings\nC2 activity around both victim and upstream T2 communication slowed down before spamming ended around 22 June. After spamming ceased, C2 activity continued albeit at a lower volume.\n\n  \n15 new C2s set up after spamming ended have been identified so far. Additionally, the number of existing C2s communicating with the T2 layer significantly decreased with only 8 remaining past 22 June.\n\n  \nWe’ve observed interesting outbound activity from the T2 layer, targeting both publicly reported and suspected Qakbot C2s, as well as other undefined destinations. \n\n  \nThe T2 C2s connect to the same list of ports used in the process for deploying the Qakbot proxy module, with usually only one or two ports observed in a day.\n\n  \nAlthough the volume of connections, variety of destinations, and port usage appear random, over time the destination ports are used with relatively equal frequency.\n\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, port 443 was assigned to approximately 48% of the C2s extracted from Qakbot campaigns. Among those C2s, only a subset engaged in communication with the T2 layer. Within this subset, 80% were assigned port 443, making it the predominant port for communication between victims and C2s.\n\n  \nC2s are usually compromised hosts in residential IPs space, as are the other destination IPs identified from outbound T2 connections. Additional criteria like geolocation and AS organization may influence the selection of these hosts, guiding the purchase from third parties and determining which Qakbot victims become bot C2s or used for other operator activity.\n\n\n\n\nSummer Glow Up\nQakbot has a history of taking an extended break each summer before returning sometime in September, with this year's spamming activities ceasing around 22 June 2023. But are the QakBot operators actually on vacation when they aren’t spamming, or is this \"break\" a time for them to refine and update their infrastructure and tools? It's worth considering that the summer months might offer a unique opportunity for operational work, especially when their main targets in the Northern Hemisphere are often on some form of holiday, leading to a potential decline in the success rate of their attacks during this time.\n\nThe line graph below shows the volume of connections from C2s over TCP/443 to the three Tier 2 (T2) IPs geolocated in Russia.\n\nIn our previous blog post, we referred to the three T2s as RU1, RU2, and RU3. Since then, the IPs have been made public so we have included them in some of the legends accompanying the charts below. However, for the sake of simplicity and continuity, we will continue to refer to them collectively as RU* within this post.\n\nFigure 1: Volume of bot C2s connections with the T2 layer (RU1, RU2, RU3) over TCP/443\n\nAfter a very busy May, things began to slowly wind down at the end of the month before a sudden drop in connections to the T2 in early June, even though spamming continued for three more weeks until around 22 June. We were unable to identify any new T2s after this decline in activity, though traffic from some C2s persisted, suggesting that the T2 infrastructure remained unchanged. However, it wouldn’t be surprising if fresh IPs for the T2 layer are introduced before their anticipated return in late summer.\n\nAfter this drop-off, a slight spike was observed on 21 and 22 June, the last day of pre-summer mass spamming (affiliate ID obama271). Interestingly, a few more spikes occurred after this period, which we will explore further. \n\nThe graph below represents the volume of bot C2 to T2 traffic according to C2 geolocation:\n\nFigure 2: Volume of bot C2 to T2 traffic per geolocation (of C2s) for 1 May through 20 July\n\nFrom this perspective, we observe that on 2 June, US C2s all but disappeared, and traffic from Indian C2s significantly decreased. We suspect the lack of US activity is at least partially attributable to Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs null-routing the T2 layer in their networks, as noted in their recent blog post. \n\nFor curiosity’s sake, let's quickly examine data for traffic volume and timing from the perspective of likely QakBot victim to C2 communications during the same time frame:\n\nFigure 3: Volume of inbound connections to C2s from hosts that are likely infected with Qakbot\n\nAs was the case with C2 to T2 communications, we can see a winding down of activity at the end of May, however this does not drop off as suddenly at the beginning of June. Instead, victim to C2 communications appear to gradually reduce in volume up to and beyond the date QakBot ceased spamming operations (22 June).\n\nTurning back to C2 to T2 activity, the following graph is a zoomed-in view of June onward, highlighting the start of a considerable drop in activity that persists through July.\n\nFigure 4: Volume of bot C2 to T2 traffic per geolocation (of C2s) for 1 June through 20 July\n\nAccording to our data, a lull lasted from 2 June to 12 June, during which only Indian C2s communicated upstream, albeit at a drastically reduced volume compared to May. We also noted some spikes in traffic from South African C2s.\n\nWe examined the IPs from the geolocations present during this timeframe to determine whether these were legacy C2s with sporadic bursts of activity, or new C2s being incorporated into their infrastructure. \n\nOur analysis revealed:\nFifteen new C2s were set up since Qakbot ceased spamming, indicated by a green box in the timeline below.\n\n  \nSix additional C2s, active since before June (some dating back to October and December 2022), that continued to exhibit upstream activity after spamming concluded, indicated by a blue box in the timeline below.\n\n  \nTwo C2s, new in June, that also maintained activity after spamming concluded, indicated by an orange box in the timeline below.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Timeline of most recent reported and suspected Qakbot C2s\n\nWe suspect that the IPs in the above timeline represent new and existing C2s intended for use upon Qakbot’s return post-summer glow up break. Most of the C2s established after spamming ceased have only a few connections to the T2 and for brief durations, possibly indicative of C2s that are not currently active but were prepared or primed for future spamming. \n\nWe will continue monitoring Qakbot during their summer break for any signs of changes in their infrastructure or how they operate.\n\nThe Mystery of the Outbound Tier 2 Connections\nWhilst examining NetFlow data for the C2 to T2 communications from which we derived the findings described above, we kept making the same unexpected observation. A clear pattern of communications sourced from the T2s, where QakBot C2s were the destination, i.e., the reverse of the traffic we were examining. These communications occurred over the same 32 ports: 20, 21, 22, 53, 80, 443, 465, 990, 993, 995, 1194, 2078, 2083, 2087, 2222, 3389, 6881, 6882, 6883, 8443, 32100, 32101, 32102, 32103, 50000, 50001, 50002, 50003, 50010, 61200, 61201, and 61202.\n\nMalware such as Qakbot, IcedID, and Emotet leverage tiered infrastructure. This consists of victim hosts communicating with bot C2s, which comprise the Tier 1 layer of the bot infrastructure, which then communicate upstream with the T2 layer. The traffic typically continues to be proxied through additional tiers of infrastructure before it reaches the pane, which is accessed by the threat actors. Aside from subtle differences, for example the ports used, this process is essentially the same for the many malware families we track. \n\nThe traffic we have observed sourced from QakBot T2s to the C2 / Tier 1 layer is atypical. When we expand our dataset to look at all outbound traffic from the T2s, we establish a larger pool of ‘T2 destination IPs’. As mentioned, some of these T2 destination IPs are publicly reported QakBot C2s. However, in the majority of cases the T2 destination IPs have not previously been identified as malicious, although many share common host characteristics associated with QakBot C2s.\n\nLet’s begin by examining what we already know. Qakbot C2s utilize various ports as defined in their malware configurations. These are the ports that an infected host would use to communicate with the bot C2. Bot C2s are generally compromised machines, often including previous Qakbot victims that have been elevated to C2 status. Our findings for 2023 reveal that 52 different ports were employed for C2s within the Qakbot configurations, including many of the ports listed above. Based on this, it is possible that the T2s are conducting a form of check-in with the C2s, utilizing the ports designated for victim traffic. \n\nWe developed a second theory based on information provided in a fantastic writeup published a few years ago by Check Point Research, where they explored how a Qakbot-infected victim ultimately receives the proxy module. After the malware ensures incoming connections are allowed in the host firewall and port forwarding is enabled, it verifies incoming connections by sending a message to a bot, with confirmation based upon the response. The payload in this message contains a list of ports that match the same destination ports the T2s are using for the mysterious outbound connections, as shown in the excerpt below.\n\nFigure 6: “An Old Bot’s Nasty New Tricks: Exploring Qbot’s Latest Attack Methods“, Check Point Research, 2020\n\nMystery solved? Unfortunately no, it wasn’t so simple. The activity that Check Point describes would appear differently in NetFlow data from what we are currently observing with respect to outbound T2 communications. Our investigation encompasses repeated connections over an extended time frame, interspersed with periods of inactivity. Usually, one to three of the T2s will sporadically reach out to the same destination IPs for months, and not in a manner that implies verification of a fixed list of available ports.\n\nHowever, this information offers another possible explanation for the activity; the mysterious outbound connections from the T2s might be related in some way to the proxy module, given the identical port list. Spoiler alert, we believe this the most likely theory based on our analysis of the NetFlow data and information currently available to us, into which we will now delve deeper.\n\n“You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.”\nSherlock Holmes\n\nNetFlow Observations I: Reported vs Unidentified C2s\nExamining the T2 destination IPs identified over a seven-month period, we discovered that only 29% of all destination IPs were reported Qakbot C2s. Of these, 79% also demonstrated typical upstream C2 to T2 bot communication over TCP/443. The remaining 71% of destination IPs were not known as malicious, although 17% of them did exhibit standard upstream C2 communication with the T2 over TCP/443. \n\nTo provide additional context for these and other data points discussed in this blog post, we compared the findings against both reported and unreported C2s. The unreported C2s were identified by monitoring communications to the T2s over TCP/443 during the same time period.\n\nFigure 7: Percentages of T2 destination IPs that are Qakbot C2s, and of IPs with upstream T2 bot communication\n\nRepeating the same process for analyzing bot C2 to T2 NetFlow data, we found that 76% of all source IPs were recognized as Qakbot C2s. Of all the C2s, only 17% had inbound connections from the T2, and within this subset, 65% were publicly reported as Qakbot C2s.\n\nFigure 8: Percentages of reported and unreported C2s with typical upstream bot traffic, and of those that are also T2 destination IPs\n\nIn summary, only 29% of the T2 destination IPs were verified as Qakbot C2s, as opposed to 76% of the C2s exhibiting upstream T2 traffic. Consequently, over 70% of the T2 destination IPs have not been observed in the wild as malicious. Furthermore, only 12% of the T2 destination IPs displayed upstream T2 bot traffic typical of a normal C2 but were not identified in the wild as Qakbot C2s. \n\nBased on these discrepancies, it seems improbable that the T2s are conducting any sort of management-related check-in for the bot C2s. \n\nNetFlow Observations II: Traffic Volume\n\n\nFigure 9: Line chart of traffic volume for outbound communication per T2 C2, spike outliers are cut off for legibility\n\nSimilar to the upstream bot C2 traffic we analyzed in our previous blog post, there are notable resemblances between RU2 and RU3 in terms of traffic volume and timing, and are also adjacent IP addresses associated with Horizon LLC (ASN 59425). In contrast, RU1 belongs to IP space assigned to SmartApe (ASN 56694), and exhibits a lower overall traffic volume compared to the other two IPs. The timing of RU1 activity generally occurs independently of RU2 and RU3, although there are occasions when all three simultaneously experience spikes in volume. \n\nNext, we will present a comparison of all T2 outbound communication juxtaposed with typical C2 to T2 bot communication, irrespective of the T2 host.\n\nFigure 10: Volume of outbound connections from the T2 layer\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Volume of inbound connections to the T2 layer, from Qakbot bot C2s, over TCP/443\n\nThere are a few notable observations:\nThe traffic volume for outbound T2 connections (blue) is markedly smaller than that of standard inbound bot C2 connections (orange). If they appeared on the same chart, the outbound T2 traffic would be virtually indiscernible when compared to the bot C2 traffic.\n\n  \nOutbound T2 activity functions independently of inbound communication from C2s, meaning they do not happen concurrently.\n\n  \nInstances of increased outbound T2 connections often occur following spikes in activity for inbound bot C2 connections\n\n  \nSpikes in outbound T2 connections frequently correspond with a decline in bot C2 activity.\n\n\nBased on these findings, we hypothesize a connection between the volume and timing of bot C2 upstream activity and the outbound T2 activity we are investigating. Although there is minimal overlap between the groups of bot C2s and T2 destination IPs, it seems that both forms of T2 activity occur in a sequential manner, contingent on traffic volume. \n\nNetFlow Observations III: Port Usage Frequency \nIn Qakbot C2 configurations, many C2s (often exceeding 100) are present, but only a small subset have been observed communicating with the T2 layer in our data. Taking into account all C2s, regardless of T2 communication, we found that approximately 48% were assigned port 443, 29% port 2222, and 16% port 995. All other ports were allocated to fewer than 3% of C2s.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for C2s we’ve identified communicating upstream over TCP/443, these percentages change; around 80% of C2s are assigned port 443, 9% port 995, 5% port 2078, and 4% port 2222. The remaining ports were associated with less than 1% of C2s. \n\nIn comparison, the chart below illustrates the frequency of destination ports utilized for outbound connections from the T2:\n\nFigure 12: Frequency of ports used as destination ports in outbound T2 connections, since November 2022\n\nUpon examination, it’s immediately evident that there is no correlation between the two datasets regarding port usage frequency. Although port 443 was technically the most frequently utilized destination port for outbound T2 connections, its usage is far from the 48% seen with all reported bot C2s (regardless of T2 communication), and port 3389 was observed just as often. In fact, all of the 32 ports we identified with this type of communication were seen at roughly equivalent rates, with port 21 being the least common. \n\nOn its own, this data point might suggest some form of automation governing which ports are accessed. However, this inference alone is not sufficient. Incorporating the timing of when the ports are used in these connections could provide further insights into whether the process appears automated.\n\nOur analysis focused on the period from May through 16 June, when activity gradually diminished to become almost nonexistent.\n\nRU1\n\nFigure 13: Destination ports identified in outbound connections per day from T2 188.127.231.177\nRU2\n\nFigure 14: Destination ports identified in outbound connections per day from T2 62.204.41.187 \nRU3\n\nFigure 15: Destination ports identified in outbound connections per day from T2 62.204.41.188\n\nThis data may not be pretty, but fortunately, a detailed examination of the individual colored bars representing each port isn't essential to grasp the overarching trends of what's occurring. By viewing the visuals collectively, it's apparent that typically only a small number of ports are accessed in a single day, with usually just one or two destination IPs accessed via each port (y-axis). Interestingly, all of the T2 IPs have visually different patterns from this perspective, a finding that contradicts the general similarities observed between RU2 and RU3. However, RU2 and RU3 do share a similar volume of ports seen per day compared to RU1.\n\nDespite these variations, there are common patterns that all three hosts exhibit. For example, they all display consistent periods of inactivity, such as those occurring from May 1-2, June 4-6, and June 9-13. They also share some spikes related to the variety of different ports used for outbound connections within specific time frames, as seen on 8 June and the period around 14/15 June. \n\nSo far, we’ve determined that the T2 makes outbound connections over different ports at relatively the same frequency, with no one or two ports used far more or less than others. However, usually, only a few of the ports are seen in connections per day, and they seem to be chosen sporadically, with the exception of certain days when almost all of the ports are utilized. Regardless, over time, the T2s communicate across each of the 32 ports with a generally equal frequency.\n\nWhat remains unclear is the rhythm or cadence of how often a T2 connects to each destination IP using these ports, and whether this process is automated. If blatant automation is involved, we would anticipate a pattern of repeated connections with consistent timing and volume. Behavior attributed to human intervention wouldn't be so orderly; instead, it would appear more random and unpredictable. While automation can be configured to mimic this, we can at least rule out the more evident instances.\n\nTo delve deeper, we chose a small sample of IPs that showed inbound T2 connections over an extended period and mapped out a timeline. In this illustration, each line color symbolizes a different T2 destination IP from the sample. A spike in a line indicates that at least one of the T2 C2s connected to that IP on that day, with the Y axis representing how many of the 32 destination ports were observed in those communications.\n\nFigure 16: Volume and timing of inbound connections from the T2 for a sample of nine destination IPs\n\nExamining the timing and volume of connections for each destination IP, there appears to be no evident pattern suggesting the use of automation. The T2 C2s communicate with these IPs erratically and in inconsistent volumes. While it's conceivable that the activity is directly linked to operator actions, considering the observations previously discussed, it may actually be a hybrid of both systematic automation and random activity. \n\nWe hypothesize that the selection of ports used in connections may be determined by an automated process, yet the connections themselves seem to be responsive to the unpredictable nature of C2 bot communications that outbound T2 connections appear to follow.\n\nNetFlow Observations IV: Characteristics of Destination IPs \nTo enrich our analysis, we examined and compared characteristics such as AS and geolocation to those of hosts identified from typical upstream bot communication. Some T2 destination IPs were confirmed as proxies and subsequently removed from the data to prevent skewing observations based on specific host details.\n\nWe first compared geolocations between T2 destination IPs and bot C2s identified from November to July 2023. We identified geolocations that were unique to bot C2s and not present among T2 destination IPs. Geolocations that were shared between the two datasets appeared in differing quantities. For instance, while only 31% of bot C2s were situated in the US, this figure increased to 60% of T2 destination IPs. \n\nFigure 17: Side-by-side comparison of the geolocations that are associated bot C2s and T2 destination IPs\n\nNext, we made a similar comparison of AS designations, filtered by geolocations with more than one IP. As pointed out by Black Lotus Labs, Qakbot seems to favor compromised hosts located in residential IP space, and our findings align with this observation. We found that Comcast is the predominant AS organization for both bot C2s and T2 destination IPs. According to our NetFlow data, the vast majority of US-based T2 destination IPs and (high confidence) bot C2s with upstream T2 connections are located within Comcast’s IP space. \n\nFigure 18: Side-by-side comparison of AS organizations associated with bot C2s and T2 destination IPs. Click the image to view it in full screen for better legibility.\n\nThese characteristics lead us to develop a theory that additional criteria, such as geolocation and AS organization, may influence the selection of compromised hosts. These factors could determine which hosts are purchased from third parties, or decide which Qakbot victims are escalated to the status of bot C2s or become T2 destination IPs, at least in some cases.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we have sought to continue our understanding of the relationship between the various tiers of infrastructure associated with the QakBot operation. Our data illustrates the winding down of operations leading up to QakBot’s seasonal ‘lull’ in operations, which appears in part to have been accelerated by good work from Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs. However, we also demonstrate that there is not a total cessation in operations, new infrastructure continues to be stood up albeit at a reduced cadence - likely for future use once spamming recommences.\n\nWe have also sought to illuminate interesting communications sourced from QakBot’s upstream infrastructure, with outbound traffic occurring to both reported and unreported QakBot C2s, as well as currently undefined servers. We have demonstrated possible relationships between this activity and inbound communications to the same upstream infrastructure, noting that activity does not overlap, but one may precede the other.\n\nWe have established an interest in 32 specific ports, which the upstream infrastructure seeks to communicate with, potentially associated with QakBot’s proxy module. We have also shown that this activity is, at least in part, possibly human-generated, with some reliance on automation for certain elements of the activity (specifying ports).\n\nFinally, we hypothesized that certain factors may be considered when elevating a victim / compromised host to C2 status; including geolocation and who the host is assigned to from a hosting perspective.\n\nDrawing this all together, we hope to have provided some interesting leads into further investigation of the QakBot operation, as well as providing opportunities for identification and mitigation of its threat. In elevating victims to be used as C2 infrastructure with T2 communication, QakBot effectively punishes users twice, first in the initial compromise, and second in the potential risk to reputation of a host being identified publicly as malicious. \n\nWe believe cutting off communications to the upstream servers is an effective remedy to the second part of this process; meaning that victim machines are cut off from further C2 instructions and in doing so protecting current and future users from compromise.\n\nRecommendations\n\nUsers of Pure Signal Recon and Scout are able to follow this activity by querying for the three Russian T2 IPs.\n\n  \nCyber defenders should monitor for inbound connections from the three Russian T2 IPs over the ports listed below. \n\n  \nIn addition, to identify any compromised hosts that were elevated to Qakbot C2 status, monitor for outbound connections from the host to any of the T2 IPs over TCP/443.\n\n\n\n\nIndicators of Compromise\nPorts\n20 \n21 \n22 \n53 \n80 \n443 \n465 \n990 \n993 \n995 \n1194 \n2078 \n2083 \n2087 \n2222 \n3389 \n6881 \n6882 \n6883 \n8443 \n32100 \n32101 \n32102 \n32103 \n50000 \n50001 \n50002 \n50003 \n50010 \n61200 \n61201 \n61202\n\nRU T2\n188.127.231.177\n62.204.41.187\n62.204.41.188\n\nNew Bot C2s (Figure 5)\n\n73.32.187.91 \n81.20.248.72 \n103.107.36.56 \n113.193.95.44 \n113.193.166.238 \n180.151.16.132 \n197.86.195.132 \n197.87.63.16 \n197.87.135.186 \n197.87.135.218 \n197.87.143.152 \n197.87.143.229 \n197.89.10.173 \n197.92.136.237 \n201.130.167.212\n\nOther C2s Observed Active January - July 2023\n\nHigh Confidence\n23.30.22.225\n23.30.22.230\n23.30.173.133\n24.9.220.167\n27.0.48.205\n27.0.48.233\n27.109.19.90\n43.243.215.206\n43.243.215.210\n49.248.11.251\n50.248.58.241\n59.153.96.4\n64.237.207.9\n64.237.212.162\n64.237.221.254\n64.237.245.195\n64.237.251.199\n67.177.41.245\n67.177.42.38\n67.187.130.101\n68.59.64.105\n68.62.199.70\n69.242.31.249\n73.0.34.177\n73.1.85.92\n73.22.121.210\n73.29.92.128\n73.36.196.11\n73.41.215.237\n73.60.227.230\n73.78.215.104\n73.88.173.113\n73.127.53.140\n73.155.10.79\n73.161.176.218\n73.161.178.173\n73.165.119.20\n73.197.85.237\n73.207.160.219\n73.215.22.78\n73.223.248.31\n73.226.175.11\n73.228.158.175\n73.230.28.7\n74.92.243.113\n74.92.243.115\n74.93.148.97\n75.149.21.157\n76.16.49.134\n76.27.40.189\n79.168.224.165\n89.203.252.238\n96.87.28.170\n98.37.25.99\n98.222.212.149\n99.251.67.229\n99.252.190.205\n99.254.167.145\n102.130.200.134\n103.11.80.148\n103.12.133.134\n103.42.86.42\n103.42.86.110\n103.42.86.238\n103.42.86.246\n103.71.20.249\n103.71.21.107\n103.87.128.228\n103.111.70.66\n103.111.70.115\n103.113.68.33\n103.123.221.16\n103.123.223.76\n103.123.223.121\n103.123.223.124\n103.123.223.125\n103.123.223.130\n103.123.223.131\n103.123.223.132\n103.123.223.133\n103.123.223.141\n103.123.223.144\n103.123.223.153\n103.123.223.168\n103.123.223.171\n103.134.117.111\n103.176.239.98\n103.195.16.175\n103.211.63.108\n103.212.19.254\n103.221.68.250\n103.231.216.238\n103.252.7.228\n103.252.7.231\n103.252.7.238\n109.49.47.10\n113.11.92.30\n114.143.176.234\n114.143.176.235\n114.143.176.236\n114.143.176.237\n117.248.109.38\n119.82.120.15\n119.82.120.175\n119.82.121.87\n119.82.121.251\n119.82.122.226\n119.82.123.160\n125.63.121.38\n157.119.85.203\n174.58.146.57\n174.171.10.179\n174.171.129.247\n174.171.130.96\n180.151.13.23\n180.151.19.13\n180.151.104.240\n180.151.108.14\n183.82.107.190\n183.82.112.209\n183.87.163.165\n183.87.192.196\n189.151.95.176\n195.146.105.72\n197.83.246.187\n197.83.246.199\n197.90.177.242\n197.92.136.122\n197.92.141.173\n197.94.78.32\n197.94.95.20\n197.148.17.17\n200.8.245.72\n201.130.116.138\n201.130.119.176\n201.142.207.183\n202.142.98.62\n203.109.44.236\nMedium Confidence\n​49.205.181.242\n64.237.188.252\n64.237.213.86\n69.255.128.224\n73.14.226.243\n73.45.247.179\n76.149.184.246\n96.85.69.170\n96.85.69.171\n96.92.67.169\n98.244.148.34\n103.204.192.220\n138.68.166.127\n138.197.95.196\n175.100.177.171\n180.151.18.235\n180.151.107.118\n180.151.118.243\n183.82.122.136\n187.199.135.157\n187.211.104.152\n187.211.105.137\n189.248.64.238\n197.92.131.106\n201.142.195.172\n201.142.197.29\n201.142.213.13",

      "content:encoded": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In this blog post, we will provide an update on our continued analysis and tracking of infrastructure associated with IcedID’s BackConnect (BC) protocol; a continuation of the analysis we shared in late-December 2022, which you can read <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/inside-the-icedid-backconnect-protocol\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">here</span></a></u>, in addition to our <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/a-visualizza-into-recent-icedid-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">campaign metrics</span></a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/tracking-bokbot-icedid-infrastructuremapping-a-vast-and-currently-active-icedid-network\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">infrastructure tracking</span></a></u> blog posts.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>Note: whilst the same BC protocol is utilized by several other threat operations, including Bazar and QakBot, this blog post focuses specifically on IcedID infrastructure.</em></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Given that it is deployed post-compromise following initial assessments of the value of a victim host, the use of the BC protocol is of particular interest to us, and remains a priority for our overall tracking of IcedID. Analyzing activity related to BC infrastructure provides a strategic view into threat actor activity and interests, as it is a window into what occurs after a successful infection and the victim was deemed valuable for their use. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Since our last post, updates were made to the version of the BC protocol used by the IcedID threat actors during mid-April 2023. The last time we observed updates to the protocol was 7 months ago in September 2022. One of the more noticeable changes, shared by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, was in the port utilized by victim hosts when connecting to the BC command and control (C2) server, which was updated from TCP/8080 to TCP/443. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In our previous blog post, we referenced 11 IcedID BC C2 servers, active from the beginning of July 2022 through the end of 2022. Our analysis highlighted that generally two C2 servers were active at any given time, and the average life cycle for a C2 server was around four weeks. We will revisit this C2 timeline in order to assess how IcedID’s use of the BC protocol has evolved over the past six months, and in doing so also review the associated management infrastructure used to access / administer it.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>The overall quantity of BC C2s has increased. \t</p><ul>\n  <li><p>A total of 34 medium and high confidence IcedID BC C2 servers were identified since 23 January 2023, up from 11 we observed from July 2022 until the end of the year.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n  <li><p>The average life cycle for a BC C2 has decreased.</p><ul>\n  <li><p>The average uptime of a BC C2 decreased from 28 days to eight days, and concurrently active servers increased from two to a maximum of four.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n  <li><p>Additional management infrastructure has been identified.</p><ul>\n  <li><p>Management activity continues to be sourced from two static VPN nodes, with other common management peers observed.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n  <li><p>Management-related activity has evolved from our last blog post.</p><ul>\n  <li><p>Management activity now varies from C2 to C2, we do not always observe connections from the same management IPs.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Observed management activity is likely a mix of IcedID operator and affiliate access.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n  <li><p>Victims can communicate with multiple BC C2 servers over time.</p></li>\n  <li><p>A possible connection between BC-infected victims and spamming activity was identified.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>C2 Server Timeline</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>As explained in our previous blog post, a methodology was established for tracking BC C2 servers based on the observance of management traffic from a number of static IP addresses. By regularly monitoring outbound traffic from these IPs, we continue to identify new C2 servers as communications commence.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_78c50f321a7e4292840f72df814497e6~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_745,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: IcedID BC Protocol Management - c. November 2022</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In this instance, <em>management traffic</em> is defined as IP addresses observed in communications with multiple C2 servers, connecting to specific ports of interest, in repeated established sessions. The <em>established sessions</em> element is inferred based upon observed ephemeral ports and TCP flags, in simple terms; scenarios involving a consistent ephemeral port with evidence of a successful TCP three-way handshake and subsequent activity / data transfer.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_5bcaa032fd524594be27aec15059753a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_802,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 3: A Simple Visualization of the Previous Waffle </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Getting back to the C2 servers, the following timeline illustrates the periods when we observed management traffic, and by extension an indication of when the C2 servers were in active use.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Whilst this section is based on the enumeration of BC C2 servers <em>since</em> the aforementioned updates in April 2023, for completeness we include all identified C2 servers (since the beginning of 2023) in the <em>Indicators of Compromise</em> section at the end of this post.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_a52233c7f60e4db28c442c97dc9b5305~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_353,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4: Timeline of BC C2 Servers from mid-April 2023 Onwards</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Since 11 April 2023, a total of 20 high confidence BC C2 servers were identified, based on pivots from management infrastructure.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The first observation is that the number of concurrent C2 servers in operation has increased since our previous blog post, with as many as four C2 servers receiving management communications on a particular day. We also note that the life cycle of the C2 servers has decreased significantly, from around 28 days to just over eight.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_ec69db12386744b1ae98db4e079bca84~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_683,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 5: Previous Timeline - July to December 2022</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>There are a number of hypothesized reasons for these changes and each one is not independent of the others (nor is the following list exhaustive):</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Greater awareness of BC infrastructure has resulted in faster response times; both in reporting to hosting providers and mitigation activities; leading to a shorter C2 shelf-life.</p></li>\n  <li><p>An increase in the use of the BC protocol by IcedID threat actors and their affiliates has required additional infrastructure to be stood up.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Disruption / changes to activities has increased the need for additional back-up / fall-over C2 servers.</p></li>\n  <li><p>General evolution of threat actor modus operandi - e.g. “statistics show that an individual C2 server reaches its peak potential on day N (&lt;28 days), so why not rotate them more often?”. We know from analyzing other IcedID infrastructure that the admins run a metrics-influenced operation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Since IcedID returned from its winter hiatus on 23 January 2023 through the end of June 2023, we have identified 34 medium (50-75%) and high (75-99%) confidence BC C2 servers. In the case of the four medium confidence C2 servers, we (Team Cymru) were not able to confirm their usage with the same veracity, but on the balance of probabilities are likely connected to IcedID BC activity; indeed some were reported by other researchers.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Management Infrastructure</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In this section we will provide background context on the IP addresses we have observed accessing the BC C2s on particular ports of interest; namely TCP/8082, TCP/8083, and TCP/8101.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We assess that TCP/8082 relates to the BC SOCKS proxy, TCP/8083 to VNC (screen sharing), however at this stage it is unclear what the use of TCP/8101 relates to. We began to observe this port (TCP/8081) open on BC C2 servers over the past few months.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The two IP addresses we detailed in our previous blog post (see Figure 2) continue to be used to access BC C2 servers, however they are no longer observed in every single case.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>The <strong>VNC Management IP</strong> continues to be accessed from IP addresses assigned to MOLDTELECOM-AS and was last observed communicating with BC C2 servers in early July 2023.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>The <strong>SOCKS Management IP</strong> continues to be accessed from an IP address assigned to a Ukrainian ISP, interspersed with irregular connections from Starlink infrastructure. Communications with BC C2 servers was last observed in early June 2023.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Over the past six months, we have observed other IPs accessing the BC C2 servers. By following the activities of a number of these IPs we are able to fill in the blanks where we don’t see communications from those two originally identified management nodes.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>It is unclear why the IPs accessing the C2s vary depending on C2, ; although it is plausible to assess that the activity originates from both IcedID operators and their affiliates.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The recently identified management IPs fall into three distinct categories:</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Private VPN Nodes</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>These IPs appear to be utilized in the same way as the initial two management IPs, with a limited number of inbound peers. Outbound traffic is broadly limited to IcedID BC-related infrastructure, with connections occurring on all three ports of interest.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>German Node</strong> </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>This IP connects to BC C2 servers on TCP/8101 and is currently active at the time of writing. Aside from connections to BC C2 servers, we also observe inbound connections from Tor relays - hinting at how this node is accessed.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Latvian Node</strong> </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>This IP connects to BC C2 servers on TCP/8082 and TCP/8083 and is also currently active at the time of writing. This IP is observed in traffic indicative of blockchain/cryptocurrency trading and the use of Tor and Tox messenger. TCP/1194, commonly associated with OpenVPN, is open on this IP - again hinting at how this node is accessed.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Russian Node </strong></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>This IP connects to BC C2 servers on TCP/8082 and TCP/8101 and is also currently active at the time of writing. Aside from connections to BC C2 servers, we also observe outbound connections utilizing common mail ports (25, 143, 468, 993, etc).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6283c5_21e0bb67f85944899c8b3f78b6462a60~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_737,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 6: Private VPN Nodes - Hypothesized Management Access</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Jump Boxes</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In February we published a <u><a href=\"https://www.team-cymru.com/post/from-chile-with-malware\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\">blog post</span></a></u> stemming from an investigation into an IP address which was observed connecting to various elements/levels of the IcedID infrastructure, including BC C2 servers.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\n\nIn this blog post, we will provide an update on our continued analysis and tracking of infrastructure associated with IcedID’s BackConnect (BC) protocol; a continuation of the analysis we shared in late-December 2022, which you can read here, in addition to our campaign metrics and infrastructure tracking blog posts.\n\nNote: whilst the same BC protocol is utilized by several other threat operations, including Bazar and QakBot, this blog post focuses specifically on IcedID infrastructure.\n\nGiven that it is deployed post-compromise following initial assessments of the value of a victim host, the use of the BC protocol is of particular interest to us, and remains a priority for our overall tracking of IcedID. Analyzing activity related to BC infrastructure provides a strategic view into threat actor activity and interests, as it is a window into what occurs after a successful infection and the victim was deemed valuable for their use. \n\nSince our last post, updates were made to the version of the BC protocol used by the IcedID threat actors during mid-April 2023. The last time we observed updates to the protocol was 7 months ago in September 2022. One of the more noticeable changes, shared by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, was in the port utilized by victim hosts when connecting to the BC command and control (C2) server, which was updated from TCP/8080 to TCP/443. \n\nIn our previous blog post, we referenced 11 IcedID BC C2 servers, active from the beginning of July 2022 through the end of 2022. Our analysis highlighted that generally two C2 servers were active at any given time, and the average life cycle for a C2 server was around four weeks. We will revisit this C2 timeline in order to assess how IcedID’s use of the BC protocol has evolved over the past six months, and in doing so also review the associated management infrastructure used to access / administer it.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe overall quantity of BC C2s has increased. \t\n\n  \nA total of 34 medium and high confidence IcedID BC C2 servers were identified since 23 January 2023, up from 11 we observed from July 2022 until the end of the year.\n\n\nThe average life cycle for a BC C2 has decreased.\n\n  \nThe average uptime of a BC C2 decreased from 28 days to eight days, and concurrently active servers increased from two to a maximum of four.\n\n\nAdditional management infrastructure has been identified.\n\n  \nManagement activity continues to be sourced from two static VPN nodes, with other common management peers observed.\n\n\nManagement-related activity has evolved from our last blog post.\n\n  \nManagement activity now varies from C2 to C2, we do not always observe connections from the same management IPs.\n\n  \nObserved management activity is likely a mix of IcedID operator and affiliate access.\n\n\nVictims can communicate with multiple BC C2 servers over time.\n\n  \nA possible connection between BC-infected victims and spamming activity was identified.\n\n\n\n\nC2 Server Timeline\n\nAs explained in our previous blog post, a methodology was established for tracking BC C2 servers based on the observance of management traffic from a number of static IP addresses. By regularly monitoring outbound traffic from these IPs, we continue to identify new C2 servers as communications commence.\n\nFigure 2: IcedID BC Protocol Management - c. November 2022\n\nIn this instance, management traffic is defined as IP addresses observed in communications with multiple C2 servers, connecting to specific ports of interest, in repeated established sessions. The established sessions element is inferred based upon observed ephemeral ports and TCP flags, in simple terms; scenarios involving a consistent ephemeral port with evidence of a successful TCP three-way handshake and subsequent activity / data transfer.\n\nFigure 3: A Simple Visualization of the Previous Waffle \n\nGetting back to the C2 servers, the following timeline illustrates the periods when we observed management traffic, and by extension an indication of when the C2 servers were in active use.\n\nWhilst this section is based on the enumeration of BC C2 servers since the aforementioned updates in April 2023, for completeness we include all identified C2 servers (since the beginning of 2023) in the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of this post.\n\nFigure 4: Timeline of BC C2 Servers from mid-April 2023 Onwards\n\nSince 11 April 2023, a total of 20 high confidence BC C2 servers were identified, based on pivots from management infrastructure.\n\nThe first observation is that the number of concurrent C2 servers in operation has increased since our previous blog post, with as many as four C2 servers receiving management communications on a particular day. We also note that the life cycle of the C2 servers has decreased significantly, from around 28 days to just over eight.\n\nFigure 5: Previous Timeline - July to December 2022\n\nThere are a number of hypothesized reasons for these changes and each one is not independent of the others (nor is the following list exhaustive):\n\nGreater awareness of BC infrastructure has resulted in faster response times; both in reporting to hosting providers and mitigation activities; leading to a shorter C2 shelf-life.\n\n  \nAn increase in the use of the BC protocol by IcedID threat actors and their affiliates has required additional infrastructure to be stood up.\n\n  \nDisruption / changes to activities has increased the need for additional back-up / fall-over C2 servers.\n\n  \nGeneral evolution of threat actor modus operandi - e.g. “statistics show that an individual C2 server reaches its peak potential on day N (<28 days), so why not rotate them more often?”. We know from analyzing other IcedID infrastructure that the admins run a metrics-influenced operation.\n\n\n\n\nSince IcedID returned from its winter hiatus on 23 January 2023 through the end of June 2023, we have identified 34 medium (50-75%) and high (75-99%) confidence BC C2 servers. In the case of the four medium confidence C2 servers, we (Team Cymru) were not able to confirm their usage with the same veracity, but on the balance of probabilities are likely connected to IcedID BC activity; indeed some were reported by other researchers.\n\nManagement Infrastructure\n\nIn this section we will provide background context on the IP addresses we have observed accessing the BC C2s on particular ports of interest; namely TCP/8082, TCP/8083, and TCP/8101.\n\nWe assess that TCP/8082 relates to the BC SOCKS proxy, TCP/8083 to VNC (screen sharing), however at this stage it is unclear what the use of TCP/8101 relates to. We began to observe this port (TCP/8081) open on BC C2 servers over the past few months.\n\nThe two IP addresses we detailed in our previous blog post (see Figure 2) continue to be used to access BC C2 servers, however they are no longer observed in every single case.\n\nThe VNC Management IP continues to be accessed from IP addresses assigned to MOLDTELECOM-AS and was last observed communicating with BC C2 servers in early July 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nThe SOCKS Management IP continues to be accessed from an IP address assigned to a Ukrainian ISP, interspersed with irregular connections from Starlink infrastructure. Communications with BC C2 servers was last observed in early June 2023.\n\n\n\n\nOver the past six months, we have observed other IPs accessing the BC C2 servers. By following the activities of a number of these IPs we are able to fill in the blanks where we don’t see communications from those two originally identified management nodes.\n\nIt is unclear why the IPs accessing the C2s vary depending on C2, ; although it is plausible to assess that the activity originates from both IcedID operators and their affiliates.\n\nThe recently identified management IPs fall into three distinct categories:\n\nPrivate VPN Nodes\n\nThese IPs appear to be utilized in the same way as the initial two management IPs, with a limited number of inbound peers. Outbound traffic is broadly limited to IcedID BC-related infrastructure, with connections occurring on all three ports of interest.\n\nGerman Node \n\nThis IP connects to BC C2 servers on TCP/8101 and is currently active at the time of writing. Aside from connections to BC C2 servers, we also observe inbound connections from Tor relays - hinting at how this node is accessed.\n\nLatvian Node \n\nThis IP connects to BC C2 servers on TCP/8082 and TCP/8083 and is also currently active at the time of writing. This IP is observed in traffic indicative of blockchain/cryptocurrency trading and the use of Tor and Tox messenger. TCP/1194, commonly associated with OpenVPN, is open on this IP - again hinting at how this node is accessed.\n\nRussian Node \n\nThis IP connects to BC C2 servers on TCP/8082 and TCP/8101 and is also currently active at the time of writing. Aside from connections to BC C2 servers, we also observe outbound connections utilizing common mail ports (25, 143, 468, 993, etc).\n\nFigure 6: Private VPN Nodes - Hypothesized Management Access\n\nJump Boxes\n\nIn February we published a blog post stemming from an investigation into an IP address which was observed connecting to various elements/levels of the IcedID infrastructure, including BC C2 servers. This IP was geolocated to Chile, but there was clear evidence that it was utilized by a Russian-speaking operator.\n\nSince our last post, we have observed the Chilean jump box was accessed via an OpenVPN connection from an IP geolocated to Switzerland - assigned to Private Layer Inc, a Panamanian-registered VPS provider.\n\nWe have continued to monitor this Swiss IP, which has led to the identification of further jump boxes, utilized in much the same way as we described in the blog.\n\nFigure 7: Jump Box Management and Identification\n\nSince June, an IP geolocated to the United States has been used as the current jump box and again this has included access to BC C2 servers.\n\nWe continue to assess that this infrastructure is associated with IcedID administration.\n\nRussian Telecommunications (Rostelecom)\n\nThese appear to be consumer IPs which, based on data from Spur Intelligence, are utilized as small gateways for a limited number of concurrent users. We have observed numerous IPs (with no cross-over in usage) assigned to Rostelecom, Russia’s largest ISP, in communication with BC C2 servers using port TCP/8083.\n\nWhois information for these IPs is consistent in identifying them as previous VolgaTelecom infrastructure for the Mari El region of Russia. VolgaTelecom was absorbed by Rostelecom in 2011; it is unclear if this infrastructure continues to serve Mari El, however this may provide an indication of the end user’s location if so.\n\nOutside of the connections to BC C2 servers, we observe general Internet usage, BitTorrent activity, and evidence of the use of crypto-mining software.\n\nVictimology\n\nIn simple terms, victimology refers to the practice of understanding and studying the characteristics of victims versus focusing on the perpetrators. In cyber threat research we can use victim to C2 communications, at a large scale, to understand trends in threat activity.\n\nWe looked for potential victims by identifying activity that matched typical C2 communication over TCP/443, excluding traffic that was likely researcher or scanner related. Eventually a sample of eight candidate victim IPs from various ASNs and geographical regions was collected, all of which communicated with three or more BC C2s over a relatively long period of time. We found there were many other potential victims connections to the C2 servers, but the majority communicated with only one or two, and for shorter time periods. \n\nIn the timeline below, connections with the BC C2 servers for each victim is indicated by a line next to the geolocation of the victim. Each box on a line represents the start and end date of communication between the victim and the C2 server listed within the box. Underneath the x-axis of the timeline are flags showing when we first spotted the C2 in the management infrastructure we monitor (a replication of Figure 4).\n\nFigure 8: BC Victim Timeline\n\nFor all of the victims in our sample, first connections to a new BC C2 server began after we identified the C2 via monitoring the management related IPs mentioned in the section above. The two management nodes we originally wrote about in our previous blog only communicated with five of the BC C2 servers, and in some cases this only occurred after victim traffic had commenced.\n\nThis is a good example of why we continuously update our tracking of upstream threat actor infrastructure, whilst it might remain static for a duration, this infrastructure can change or be superseded by other key hosts. In the case of IcedID BC infrastructure we were able to adapt our insights by continuing to pivot from NetFlow data for known BC C2 servers.\n\nWe see that victims can communicate with multiple BC C2s over time while they remain infected, but not every victim communicates with every new C2. In fact, there is no discernable pattern around how long a victim communicates with a C2, when victims switch to a new C2, or which C2 servers a victim communicates with. \n\nHowever, when we pivot to analyzing the volume of traffic between victims and C2s, we finally see a pattern emerge.\n\nFigure 9: Spikes in BC Victim Traffic Volume\n\nRegardless of C2, some days show jumps in traffic volume between the victims and C2 servers. For example, on 13 June 2023 there was a spike for the British, Japanese, and German victims, but they were not communicating with the same C2. The German and Japanese victims were communicating with C2 207.154.203.203, while the British victim was communicating with C2 68.183.198.18.\n\nThis is potentially indicative of the overall coordination of IcedID victims interacted with using the BC protocol. Whilst victims may be communicating with separate C2 servers, we see peaks in activity within the same time parameters. This points to the same IcedID operator or affiliate accessing multiple victims for a specific purpose, likely via a panel which consolidates all victims together regardless of specific C2 server.\n\nTCP/587 and TCP/465 Activity\n\nWhile analyzing victim NetFlow data, we found that all eight victims from our sample group shared outbound connections to some of the same obscure mail servers over TCP/465 and TCP/587, typically in bursts on the same day. We hypothesize these communications may be connected to IcedID delivery / spam operations. \n\nOften we observe the victims connecting to the same mail servers concurrently, or scenarios when victims switch between mail servers which are ultimately in the same pool. Essentially, there is a lot of overlap which appears more than just coincidental, where batches of victim machines are used, presumably using the SOCKS element of BC, to access mail servers. When we look back into our data, we observe this pattern of activity occurring as far back as March 2023, and potentially even before.\n\nAdditionally, the bursts of activity coincide quite clearly with the previous line chart showing the volume of connections between victims and BC C2s, specifically on:\n\n10, 19, and 30 May 2023\n\n  \n13, 23, and 24 June (and an uptick at the end of the research window, 26/27 June) 2023\n\n\n\nFigure 10: BC Victim Mail Server Traffic\n\nAre they related? Based on the comparison of the two charts, it seems likely. On the days where victims had a spike in BC C2 traffic, there was also a burst of activity from victims sending outbound connections to mail servers over TCP/587 (and sometimes TCP/465). It is unlikely that such a random group of victims would coincidently have the same type of activity on the same days, repeatedly over months. It’s far more unlikely that it would also coincidently align with victim/BC C2 activity. \n\nWhilst we have no definitive proof at this point in time, our current hypothesis, based on the findings described above, is that BC is used (at least in part) to enable spamming operations associated with IcedID and their affiliates. Specifically, the SOCKS element of BC is used to proxy connections to mail servers via a subset of IcedID victims.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this blog post we have outlined how IcedID BC infrastructure has expanded over the first half of 2023; with an increase in C2 servers observed in total, and in parallel use at any point in time. \n\nWe have also discussed some of our techniques for tracking emergent C2 infrastructure, often on a timeline whereby identification occurs before victim traffic is observed. Early identification is key to preventing future compromise, threat actor-victim interaction and eventual data / financial loss.\n\nIn examining management infrastructure associated with IcedID BC, we are also able to discern a pattern of multiple distinct accesses from users we assess to be both associated with the day to day operations of IcedID, and their affiliates who interact with victim hosts post-compromise.\n\nThrough victimology analysis we are also able to provide a hypothesized purpose for the BC protocol; we would assume one of several purposes. The evidence in our NetFlow data suggests that certain IcedID victims are used as proxies in spamming operations, enabled by BC’s SOCKS capabilities.\n\nThis is a potential double blow for victims, not only are they compromised and incurring data / financial loss, but they are also further exploited for the purposes of spreading further IcedID campaigns.\n\nRecommendations\n\nUsers of Pure SignalTM Recon and Scout can follow this activity by pivoting from the BC C2 servers provided in the IOCs section at the end of this blog post.\n\n  \nIn general we would recommend that the IOCs are used for cyber defense measures; both proactive blocking and reactive threat hunting. Threatfox is an excellent open-source resource for up to date IOCs relating to IcedID and many other threat campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nIndicators of Compromise\nBC C2 Servers\n\n5.196.196.252\n135.148.217.85\n80.66.88.71\n45.61.137.220\n193.239.85.16\n185.99.132.16\n167.99.235.95 (Medium)\n162.33.179.145\n46.21.153.153\n193.149.176.100\n45.61.139.144\n45.61.137.159 (Medium)\n45.61.139.235 (Medium)\n193.149.176.198\n192.153.57.134\n193.149.187.7\n162.33.179.218\n139.59.33.128\n138.197.146.18\n167.99.248.131\n134.122.62.178\n104.248.223.35\n64.227.48.93\n209.38.220.183\n161.35.166.97\n138.68.244.54\n68.183.198.18\n207.154.203.203\n64.227.146.71\n116.203.30.206 (Medium)\n139.59.186.140\n139.59.72.105\n104.248.21.165\n159.89.116.11",

The name itself (Vidar) is derived from a string found in the malware’s code, alluding to the Norse god Víðarr.

Therefore, the intention of this blog post is to provide a comprehensive update on how Vidar is administered / operated today.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><p>Vidar threat actors continue to rotate their backend IP infrastructure, favoring providers in Moldova and Russia.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Evidence suggests that since our last blog post, the threat actors have taken steps to anonymize their activities using public VPN services.</p></li>\n  <li><p>By tracking the hosting of the main Vidar site (presently <strong>my-odin[.]com</strong>), we are able to monitor other aspects of the threat actors infrastructure, potentially illuminating both affiliates and victims.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2>Vidar’s Spring Makeover(s)</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Since August 2022, Vidar threat actors have utilized the domain <strong>my-odin[.]com</strong> as the primary location for managing various elements of their operation, including affiliate authentication, file sharing, and panel administration. Previously, it was possible to download any files hosted on the URL path /private, such as the bash script responsible for installing the necessary components for a new Vidar campaign, making it possible to monitor malware updates. However, more recently, changes were made whereby if an unauthenticated attempt to download a file occurs, the user is redirected to the Vidar affiliate login page.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In the period since our previous blog post was published, there were two updates to the IP address used to host <strong>my-odin[.]com</strong>. In parallel with these changes, updates were also made to the background infrastructure supporting the Vidar operation, which we will detail below.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Technically speaking, the IP address for <strong>my-odin[.]com</strong> was updated three times, however in the case of the update from <strong>186.2.166.15</strong> (ProManaged LLC) to <strong>5.252.179.201</strong> (MivoCloud SRL) very little else changed, with the infrastructure remaining largely as described in our previous blog post (Figure 1).</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>March 2023</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>At the end of March 2023 the IP address was updated from <strong>5.252.179.201</strong> to <strong>5.252.176.49</strong>, with the threat actors continuing their use of MivoCloud SRL-assigned infrastructure. With this transition, other alterations were also made behind the scenes.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The primary IP address (the ‘Managing IP’ in Figure 1) used to manage <strong>5.252.176.49</strong> was accessed via ‘new’ peers, utilizing the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). As far as we can tell, this server was previously accessed directly.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>From mid-March 2023 onwards, the RDP management activity was sourced from ProtonVPN relays which appeared to be used more broadly by other users, mainly for benign activities.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>By using VPN infrastructure, which in at least part was also utilized by numerous other benign users, it is apparent that the Vidar threat actors may be taking steps to anonymize their management activities by hiding in general Internet noise.</strong></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>In addition to the changes in how the management IP is accessed, we also observed ‘new’ outbound connections from the IP (<strong>5.252.176.49</strong>) hosting <strong>my-odin[.]com</strong>. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Communications with infrastructure associated with ‘<strong>blonk[.]co</strong>’; Blonk is a recruitment platform which utilizes AI to match candidates with opportunities, in the way that dating applications match potential partners. The precise reason for these communications being observed from Vidar management infrastructure is uncertain, however it is plausible that the threat actors may use this platform in their operations; for identifying targets / victims, or perhaps even for recruitment.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Finally, we continued to observe outbound connections to <strong>185.173.93.98</strong>:443, a host located in Russia assigned to Adman LLC. In addition to the TCP/443 traffic it was also observed in GRE tunnelling activity with <strong>5.252.176.49</strong>. This IP (<strong>185.173.93.98</strong>) operates as a conduit between Vidar’s <strong>my-odin[.]com</strong> and <em>proxy_pass</em> infrastructure (we detailed <em>proxy_pass</em> in our previous blog post).</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Figure 2 below summarizes the Vidar infrastructure as of the end of April 2023, as detailed above.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/747242_3ced27b3c2594d53bc4d70269d654108~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000,h_809,al_c,q_80/file.png\"></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Figure 2: Vidar Infrastructure as of April 2023</strong></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>May 2023</h3>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>During May 2023, we observed the initiation of the process to update the hosting IP for <strong>my-odin[.]com</strong> once more. Again (this finding was also documented in our previous blog post) the Vidar threat actors reused the same SSL certificate when transferring infrastructure, revealing the new IP address; <strong>185.229.64.137</strong> (S.C.

Vidar is considered to be a distinct fork of the Arkei malware family.\n\n\n\n\nAs of the end of January 2023 (and as described in our previous blog), Vidar’s administration and backend infrastructure was configured as follows:\n\n\nFigure 1: Vidar Infrastructure as of January 2023\n\nOver the past four months, several changes have occurred within this infrastructure configuration. Therefore, the intention of this blog post is to provide a comprehensive update on how Vidar is administered / operated today.\n\nKey Findings\n\nVidar threat actors continue to rotate their backend IP infrastructure, favoring providers in Moldova and Russia.\n\n  \nEvidence suggests that since our last blog post, the threat actors have taken steps to anonymize their activities using public VPN services.\n\n  \nBy tracking the hosting of the main Vidar site (presently my-odin[.]com), we are able to monitor other aspects of the threat actors infrastructure, potentially illuminating both affiliates and victims.\n\n\n\n\nVidar’s Spring Makeover(s)\n\nSince August 2022, Vidar threat actors have utilized the domain my-odin[.]com as the primary location for managing various elements of their operation, including affiliate authentication, file sharing, and panel administration. Previously, it was possible to download any files hosted on the URL path /private, such as the bash script responsible for installing the necessary components for a new Vidar campaign, making it possible to monitor malware updates. However, more recently, changes were made whereby if an unauthenticated attempt to download a file occurs, the user is redirected to the Vidar affiliate login page.\n\nIn the period since our previous blog post was published, there were two updates to the IP address used to host my-odin[.]com. In parallel with these changes, updates were also made to the background infrastructure supporting the Vidar operation, which we will detail below.\n\nTechnically speaking, the IP address for my-odin[.]com was updated three times, however in the case of the update from 186.2.166.15 (ProManaged LLC) to 5.252.179.201 (MivoCloud SRL) very little else changed, with the infrastructure remaining largely as described in our previous blog post (Figure 1).\n\nMarch 2023\n\nAt the end of March 2023 the IP address was updated from 5.252.179.201 to 5.252.176.49, with the threat actors continuing their use of MivoCloud SRL-assigned infrastructure. With this transition, other alterations were also made behind the scenes.\n\nThe primary IP address (the ‘Managing IP’ in Figure 1) used to manage 5.252.176.49 was accessed via ‘new’ peers, utilizing the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). As far as we can tell, this server was previously accessed directly.\n\nFrom mid-March 2023 onwards, the RDP management activity was sourced from ProtonVPN relays which appeared to be used more broadly by other users, mainly for benign activities.\n\nBy using VPN infrastructure, which in at least part was also utilized by numerous other benign users, it is apparent that the Vidar threat actors may be taking steps to anonymize their management activities by hiding in general Internet noise.\n\nIn addition to the changes in how the management IP is accessed, we also observed ‘new’ outbound connections from the IP (5.252.176.49) hosting my-odin[.]com. \n\nCommunications with infrastructure associated with ‘blonk[.]co’; Blonk is a recruitment platform which utilizes AI to match candidates with opportunities, in the way that dating applications match potential partners. The precise reason for these communications being observed from Vidar management infrastructure is uncertain, however it is plausible that the threat actors may use this platform in their operations; for identifying targets / victims, or perhaps even for recruitment.\n\nFinally, we continued to observe outbound connections to 185.173.93.98:443, a host located in Russia assigned to Adman LLC. In addition to the TCP/443 traffic it was also observed in GRE tunnelling activity with 5.252.176.49. This IP (185.173.93.98) operates as a conduit between Vidar’s my-odin[.]com and proxy_pass infrastructure (we detailed proxy_pass in our previous blog post).\n\nFigure 2 below summarizes the Vidar infrastructure as of the end of April 2023, as detailed above.\n\n\nFigure 2: Vidar Infrastructure as of April 2023\n\nMay 2023\n\nDuring May 2023, we observed the initiation of the process to update the hosting IP for my-odin[.]com once more. Again (this finding was also documented in our previous blog post) the Vidar threat actors reused the same SSL certificate when transferring infrastructure, revealing the new IP address; 185.229.64.137 (S.C. INFOTECH-GRUP S.R.L.).\n\n\nFigure 3: SSL Certificate for my-odin[.]com\n\nBased on our network telemetry data, we can see that communications with 185.229.64.137 commenced on 03 May 2023; this aligns with other open source passive DNS information for the domain resolution.\n\n\nFigure 4: Summarized Communications Involving 185.229.64.137\n\nThe behaviour of the new IP address hosting my-odin[.]com remains broadly consistent with previous (5.252.176.49), however we also observe inbound connections from Tor relays; potentially evidence of Vidar affiliates accessing their accounts / malware repositories. \n\nThe change in infrastructure detailed above is summarized in Figure 5 below.\n\n\nFigure 5: Vidar Infrastructure as of June 2023\n\nConclusion\n\nThis short update provides further insight into the ‘behind-the-scenes’ operation of Vidar, demonstrating the evolution of its management infrastructure as well as evidence of steps taken by the threat actors to potentially cover their tracks. By continuing to track this infrastructure we are able to identify future changes, as well as uncovering evidence which may support victim and/or affiliate identification.\n\nElements of the infrastructure were redacted from this blog post as investigations are currently ongoing; lower confidence aspects will be shared in the future once confirmation of findings have taken place.\n\nAs ever, we will continue to update the community on any new or emergent findings related to Vidar and other connected threats.\n\nRecommendations\n\nUsers of Pure SignalTM Recon and Scout are able to track Vidar management infrastructure by querying for my-odin[.]com or the associated hosting IP addresses referenced in this blog post.",
