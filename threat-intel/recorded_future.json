      "content:encoded": "<p>Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, making it imperative for organizations to leverage cyber threat intelligence to stay ahead of potential cyber attacks. Organizations across all industries are recognizing the importance of implementing robust threat intelligence solutions to stay ahead of cybercriminals and protect their valuable assets.</p><h2 id=\"the-role-of-threat-intelligence\">The Role of Threat Intelligence</h2><p>Organizations need to be vigilant and proactive in their approach to security to protect sensitive information and maintain business continuity. And this is where <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence\">threat intelligence</a> comes in. But what is threat intelligence?</p><p>Threat intelligence is the <strong>information an organization uses to understand the threats</strong> that have, will, or are targeting the organization. This intelligence is gathered from various sources such as <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/open-source-intelligence-definition\">open sources (OSINT)</a>, social media, technical data, and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-monitoring\">dark web monitoring</a>. The primary objective of threat intelligence is to provide actionable insights to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/what_is_threat_intelligence_definition_7bc657ef2e.webp\" alt=\"What is Threat Intelligence?\"></p><br><p>Threat intelligence can be broadly categorized into four main types:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/strategic-threat-intelligence\">Strategic threat intelligence</a></strong> - provides a high-level overview of the threat landscape, including emerging trends, geopolitical events, and major threat actors.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/tactical-threat-intelligence\">Tactical threat intelligence</a></strong> - focuses on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat intelligence actors. </li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/operational-threat-intelligence\">Operational threat intelligence</a></strong> - more immediate and actionable, detailing specific incidents and campaigns that are currently active or imminent.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/technical-threat-intelligence\">Technical threat intelligence</a></strong> - includes data on specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and malware signatures.</li></ul><p>By leveraging these various types of threat intelligence, organizations can build a comprehensive and layered defense against potential cyber threats.</p><h3 id=\"why-is-threat-intelligence-important\">Why is Threat Intelligence Important?</h3><p>According to the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/2024-data-breach-investigations-report-vulnerability-exploitation-boom-threatens-cybersecurity-1033310225\">Markets Insider Report</a>, there was a staggering increase of 3 times invulnerability exploitation in 2023. This significant rise highlights the critical need for effective threat intelligence to protect sensitive information.</p><p>The importance of threat intelligence is that it converts raw data into meaningful information that security teams can use to make informed decisions. By understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the threat actors, organizations can defend better against potential attacks. Threat intelligence also helps in identifying <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats\">emerging threats</a>, prioritizing the latest vulnerabilities, and overall security posture.</p><h3 id=\"the-components-of-threat-intelligence\">The Components of Threat Intelligence</h3><p>Effective threat intelligence is built on <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/information-gathering\">data gathering</a> and sophisticated analysis. It involves a multi-faceted approach that ensures the collected information is relevant, accurate, and actionable. Here are several key components:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering raw data from various sources, including network logs, security incidents, and external <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-feeds\">threat intel feeds</a>.</li><li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Processing and analyzing the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and indicators of potential threats.</li><li><strong>Dissemination:</strong> Sharing the analyzed intelligence with relevant stakeholders within the organization to inform security decisions and actions.</li><li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Turning the analyzed data into actionable insights that can be used to mitigate risks and enhance security measures.</li></ul><h2 id=\"how-can-threat-intelligence-use-cases-help-organizations-against-cyber-threats\">How Can Threat Intelligence Use Cases Help Organizations Against Cyber Threats?</h2><p>Threat intelligence plays a pivotal role in helping organizations defend against the ever-evolving landscape of emerging cyber threats. Because threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com\">threat intelligence platform</a>, rather than picking a solution and then trying to conform your use cases to the strengths of that solution.</p><p>Threat intelligence use cases can streamline the incident response process. In its recent <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731\">Market Guide</a>, the technology research company Gartner suggests that end users of cyber threat intelligence solutions identify their best solution by <strong>taking a use-case-centric approach</strong>.</p><p>For example, you may wish to gain insights into the identity, methods, and motives of threat actors targeting you so that you can avoid future threats and adjust or update your security; you may wish to create case studies for use in training exercises; or you may wish to gather more threat data so that you can <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence\">prioritize vulnerability management based on the risks</a> that your organization is particularly vulnerable to  Gartner provides a long list of possible use cases that are important to consider before choosing a solution.</p><p>Before making expensive and informed security decisions on how to improve your security operations and programs, review Gartners five examples below on the most effective uses of threat intelligence platforms.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5_threat_intelligence_use_cases_f78bcb495e.webp\" alt=\"Threat Intelligence Use Cases\"></p><br><h3 id=\"1-enriching-other-security-technologies-by-integrating-threat-intelligence\">1. Enriching Other Security Technologies by Integrating Threat Intelligence</h3><p>These are the basics  integrating cyber threat intelligence into your already existing security processes improves decision-making for incident response and enhances your security policy. According to Gartner, cyber threat intelligence has recently begun to be widely incorporated into most security technology verticals, including security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls and unified <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/integrations/threat-intelligence-management\">threat management systems</a>, intrusion detection and prevention, secure web gateways and secure email gateways, endpoint protection, web application protection, distributed denial of service, vulnerability management, security orchestration, and more.</p><p>If your organization does not already include threat intelligence in its security program, a good place to start is by <strong>looking at what you are already using and seeing how threat intelligence can make it more effective</strong>. Many threat intelligence solutions offer machine-readable intelligence that can integrate frictionlessly with the security products you already use, and an increasing number of solutions are using open-source standards, making it easier than ever to share data across platforms.</p><h3 id=\"2-vulnerability-prioritization-for-security-teams\">2. Vulnerability Prioritization For Security Teams</h3><p>One of the best uses for an effective <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-program\">threat intelligence program</a> is to gather data and perform analysis that will help your organization create a simple metric for evaluating vulnerabilities. This metric should be a measure of the overlap between the problems you can fix and the solutions that will make the biggest difference, given the time and resources available to you.</p><p>The traditional approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities comes from the attitude that the best security approach is to patch everything, all the time, everywhere. Achieving this goal would, in theory, lead to a perfectly impenetrable system  but it sets an impossibly high standard. So organizations that follow this approach will inevitably make compromises and go after the biggest problems first.</p><p>But, contrary to popular belief, the biggest problems (based on how much damage they actually cause) are not issues like zero-day threats or clever new exploits, but the same old vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited, precisely because so many organizations prioritize new threats within their threat hunting instead of focusing on improving their fundamentals.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">Threat actors</a> are just as limited  if not more so  by time and the resources available to them as you are. They naturally will tend to use the simplest, least resource-intensive exploit as long as it continues to provide results.</p><p>In its analysis of vulnerabilities discovered over the last decade, Gartner found that <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database\">new CVEs</a> were found at a mostly steady rate, while the number of exploits grew exponentially over the same period. This indicates that the vast majority of new exploits were variations on old ones  making it clear that any organizations top priority should be patching already-known vulnerabilities rather than worrying about new threats.</p><h3 id=\"3-open-deep-and-dark-web-monitoring\">3. Open, Deep, and Dark Web Monitoring</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence\">threat intelligence solution</a> should gather its threat data from both open and closed sources on the internet.</p><p>Open sources, in short, are publicly available to everyone on the internet. This includes all the data that is indexed on search engines, which is sometimes called the surface web. Although this comprises some 4.56 billion pages, the public part of the internet only makes up about four percent of all data online.</p><p>The other 96 percent is divided between the deep web and the dark web. The deep web, which makes up about 90 percent of that data, refers to those parts of the internet that are locked away behind secure logins or paywalls, leaving them out of the reach of search engine crawlers. Most of this information includes scientific, academic, or government reports, personal information like financial records or medical histories, and private company databases.</p><p>The dark web, which makes up the remaining six percent of all the data on the internet, is made up of websites that can only be reached through browsers like Tor, which provide encryption and anonymity. Although this is not exclusively the case, many websites provide marketplaces for illegal goods and services.</p><p><a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/cvss-score-vulnerabilities\">Vulnerabilities and their exploits</a> are commonly discussed and traded in spaces on both the dark and deep web, both by parties that would wish to keep them safe, and by threat actors. That makes it essential to gather threat data from these <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-sources\">threat intelligence sources</a> to maintain a more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of what threats are out there.</p><p>Because accessing these spaces requires more skill and comes with higher risks, one of the principal values of certain threat intelligence solutions is that they will do it for you. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731\">Gartners Market Guide</a>, it can take many years of experience to effectively infiltrate these spaces and provide effective and timely analysis, and the most effective threat intelligence program will come with expert analysis that cannot be replicated by any algorithm.</p><h3 id=\"4-brand-monitoring\">4. Brand Monitoring</h3><p>Although discussions about vulnerabilities and exploits will mostly take place in the closed parts of the internet, there is still great value in choosing an actionable threat intelligence platform that will monitor open sources as well, particularly for emerging <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/social-media-threat-intelligence\">cyber threats on social media channels</a>. Identifying threats in this arena is a skill in itself, requiring an awareness of your organizations brand and the many ways a threat actor may seek to exploit it.</p><p>Because these threats appear in public spaces and are subject to wider scrutiny, they can be more subtle, often relying on social engineering techniques instead of software exploits, and take a degree of expertise to recognize.</p><p>For example, a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence\">threat intelligence solution that includes brand monitoring</a> may look for fake or malicious social media profiles that have been accepted by your staff or even mimic your staffs profiles, identify malicious links that have been posted to your social media profiles, or even evaluate intellectual property loss and theft.</p><p>Cyber attacks that can be identified through social media and brand monitoring include phishing, false flag schemes, domain fraud, or activist or trolling attacks. Professionally developed threat intelligence solutions are much more efficient and will generate fewer false positives than open-source tools or ad hoc approaches.</p><h3 id=\"5-threat-indicator-investigation-enrichment-and-response\">5. Threat Indicator Investigation, Enrichment, and Response</h3><p>Not every attack can be prevented, of course, and one of the values of many threat intelligence solutions is their ability to improve the speed and accuracy of your incident response through operational threat intelligence.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, making it imperative for organizations to leverage cyber threat intelligence to stay ahead of potential cyber attacks. Organizations across all industries are recognizing the importance of implementing robust threat intelligence solutions to stay ahead of cybercriminals and protect their valuable assets.\nThe Role of Threat Intelligence\nOrganizations need to be vigilant and proactive in their approach to security to protect sensitive information and maintain business continuity. And this is where threat intelligence comes in. But what is threat intelligence?\nThreat intelligence is the information an organization uses to understand the threats that have, will, or are targeting the organization. This intelligence is gathered from various sources such as open sources (OSINT), social media, technical data, and dark web monitoring. The primary objective of threat intelligence is to provide actionable insights to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.\n\n\n\nThreat intelligence can be broadly categorized into four main types:\n\nStrategic threat intelligence - provides a high-level overview of the threat landscape, including emerging trends, geopolitical events, and major threat actors.\nTactical threat intelligence - focuses on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat intelligence actors. \nOperational threat intelligence - more immediate and actionable, detailing specific incidents and campaigns that are currently active or imminent.\nTechnical threat intelligence - includes data on specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and malware signatures.\n\nBy leveraging these various types of threat intelligence, organizations can build a comprehensive and layered defense against potential cyber threats.\nWhy is Threat Intelligence Important?\nAccording to the Markets Insider Report, there was a staggering increase of 3 times invulnerability exploitation in 2023. This significant rise highlights the critical need for effective threat intelligence to protect sensitive information.\nThe importance of threat intelligence is that it converts raw data into meaningful information that security teams can use to make informed decisions. By understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the threat actors, organizations can defend better against potential attacks. Threat intelligence also helps in identifying emerging threats, prioritizing the latest vulnerabilities, and overall security posture.\nThe Components of Threat Intelligence\nEffective threat intelligence is built on data gathering and sophisticated analysis. It involves a multi-faceted approach that ensures the collected information is relevant, accurate, and actionable. Here are several key components:\n\nData Collection: Gathering raw data from various sources, including network logs, security incidents, and external threat intel feeds.\nData Analysis: Processing and analyzing the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and indicators of potential threats.\nDissemination: Sharing the analyzed intelligence with relevant stakeholders within the organization to inform security decisions and actions.\nActionable Insights: Turning the analyzed data into actionable insights that can be used to mitigate risks and enhance security measures.\n\nHow Can Threat Intelligence Use Cases Help Organizations Against Cyber Threats?\nThreat intelligence plays a pivotal role in helping organizations defend against the ever-evolving landscape of emerging cyber threats. Because threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose a threat intelligence platform, rather than picking a solution and then trying to conform your use cases to the strengths of that solution.\nThreat intelligence use cases can streamline the incident response process. In its recent Market Guide, the technology research company Gartner suggests that end users of cyber threat intelligence solutions identify their best solution by taking a use-case-centric approach.\nFor example, you may wish to gain insights into the identity, methods, and motives of threat actors targeting you so that you can avoid future threats and adjust or update your security; you may wish to create case studies for use in training exercises; or you may wish to gather more threat data so that you can prioritize vulnerability management based on the risks that your organization is particularly vulnerable to  Gartner provides a long list of possible use cases that are important to consider before choosing a solution.\nBefore making expensive and informed security decisions on how to improve your security operations and programs, review Gartners five examples below on the most effective uses of threat intelligence platforms.\n\n\n\n1. Enriching Other Security Technologies by Integrating Threat Intelligence\nThese are the basics  integrating cyber threat intelligence into your already existing security processes improves decision-making for incident response and enhances your security policy. According to Gartner, cyber threat intelligence has recently begun to be widely incorporated into most security technology verticals, including security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls and unified threat management systems, intrusion detection and prevention, secure web gateways and secure email gateways, endpoint protection, web application protection, distributed denial of service, vulnerability management, security orchestration, and more.\nIf your organization does not already include threat intelligence in its security program, a good place to start is by looking at what you are already using and seeing how threat intelligence can make it more effective. Many threat intelligence solutions offer machine-readable intelligence that can integrate frictionlessly with the security products you already use, and an increasing number of solutions are using open-source standards, making it easier than ever to share data across platforms.\n2. Vulnerability Prioritization For Security Teams\nOne of the best uses for an effective threat intelligence program is to gather data and perform analysis that will help your organization create a simple metric for evaluating vulnerabilities. This metric should be a measure of the overlap between the problems you can fix and the solutions that will make the biggest difference, given the time and resources available to you.\nThe traditional approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities comes from the attitude that the best security approach is to patch everything, all the time, everywhere. Achieving this goal would, in theory, lead to a perfectly impenetrable system  but it sets an impossibly high standard. So organizations that follow this approach will inevitably make compromises and go after the biggest problems first.\nBut, contrary to popular belief, the biggest problems (based on how much damage they actually cause) are not issues like zero-day threats or clever new exploits, but the same old vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited, precisely because so many organizations prioritize new threats within their threat hunting instead of focusing on improving their fundamentals.\nThreat actors are just as limited  if not more so  by time and the resources available to them as you are. They naturally will tend to use the simplest, least resource-intensive exploit as long as it continues to provide results.\nIn its analysis of vulnerabilities discovered over the last decade, Gartner found that new CVEs were found at a mostly steady rate, while the number of exploits grew exponentially over the same period. This indicates that the vast majority of new exploits were variations on old ones  making it clear that any organizations top priority should be patching already-known vulnerabilities rather than worrying about new threats.\n3. Open, Deep, and Dark Web Monitoring\nA threat intelligence solution should gather its threat data from both open and closed sources on the internet.\nOpen sources, in short, are publicly available to everyone on the internet. This includes all the data that is indexed on search engines, which is sometimes called the surface web. Although this comprises some 4.56 billion pages, the public part of the internet only makes up about four percent of all data online.\nThe other 96 percent is divided between the deep web and the dark web. The deep web, which makes up about 90 percent of that data, refers to those parts of the internet that are locked away behind secure logins or paywalls, leaving them out of the reach of search engine crawlers. Most of this information includes scientific, academic, or government reports, personal information like financial records or medical histories, and private company databases.\nThe dark web, which makes up the remaining six percent of all the data on the internet, is made up of websites that can only be reached through browsers like Tor, which provide encryption and anonymity. Although this is not exclusively the case, many websites provide marketplaces for illegal goods and services.\nVulnerabilities and their exploits are commonly discussed and traded in spaces on both the dark and deep web, both by parties that would wish to keep them safe, and by threat actors. That makes it essential to gather threat data from these threat intelligence sources to maintain a more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of what threats are out there.\nBecause accessing these spaces requires more skill and comes with higher risks, one of the principal values of certain threat intelligence solutions is that they will do it for you. According to Gartners Market Guide, it can take many years of experience to effectively infiltrate these spaces and provide effective and timely analysis, and the most effective threat intelligence program will come with expert analysis that cannot be replicated by any algorithm.\n4. Brand Monitoring\nAlthough discussions about vulnerabilities and exploits will mostly take place in the closed parts of the internet, there is still great value in choosing an actionable threat intelligence platform that will monitor open sources as well, particularly for emerging cyber threats on social media channels. Identifying threats in this arena is a skill in itself, requiring an awareness of your organizations brand and the many ways a threat actor may seek to exploit it.\nBecause these threats appear in public spaces and are subject to wider scrutiny, they can be more subtle, often relying on social engineering techniques instead of software exploits, and take a degree of expertise to recognize.\nFor example, a threat intelligence solution that includes brand monitoring may look for fake or malicious social media profiles that have been accepted by your staff or even mimic your staffs profiles, identify malicious links that have been posted to your social media profiles, or even evaluate intellectual property loss and theft.\nCyber attacks that can be identified through social media and brand monitoring include phishing, false flag schemes, domain fraud, or activist or trolling attacks. Professionally developed threat intelligence solutions are much more efficient and will generate fewer false positives than open-source tools or ad hoc approaches.\n5. Threat Indicator Investigation, Enrichment, and Response\nNot every attack can be prevented, of course, and one of the values of many threat intelligence solutions is their ability to improve the speed and accuracy of your incident response through operational threat intelligence. In its guide, Gartner advocates shifting away from focusing on prevention toward a more balanced approach that also equally includes both threat detection and response.\nPart of this framework includes rethinking how to prioritize vulnerabilities, as detailed above. It can also be helpful to have a threat intelligence solution that allows on-demand access to submit files or objects and looks for indicators of compromise like suspicious file hashes, domain names, or addresses, and compares them to the large datasets that some solutions maintain, enriching your organizations data.\nSome solutions even have the ability to go on the hunt for threats proactively. Whereas incident response is, by definition, a reactive process, more advanced solutions can seek out threats before they are actually implemented against your organization.\nThreat hunting takes a mature organization that already maintains the fundamentals of its security stance, like keeping its systems up to date and closely monitoring its own network, but provides an invaluable additional layer of security for those organizations that can do it effectively.\nAnother Framework for Evaluating Use Cases\nGartners Market Guide also provides an easy way to evaluate different threat intelligence services based on where they fall on two scales:\n\n\nTactical - Strategic: This scale is a measurement of time. In rough terms, a tactical threat intelligence solution may be more effective in the short term, while a strategic solution will be better in the long term. For example, a solution might be considered more tactical if its strengths lie in its ability to quickly process threat data and identify potential threats, whereas a solution that offers a deeper analysis that lends itself to long-term planning for the future could better be defined as strategic.\nTechnical - Business: This scale is a measurement of risk type. In general terms, a technical threat intelligence solution will be more focused on security operations, while a strategic threat intelligence approach will deal with digital risk management. For example, a more technical solution might focus on indicators of immediate compromise like bad IP addresses or domains, but a solution that measures the risk from an emerging tactic or to a particular industry vertical is more aligned with business risk.\n\nImplementing Cyber Threat Intelligence Is Necessary\nIncorporating threat intelligence into an organization's cybersecurity strategy is crucial for staying ahead of evolving cyber threats. The implementation of threat intelligence solutions is crucial for organizations looking to strengthen their cybersecurity posture (or their security teams) and defend against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\nThreat intelligence provides the actionable insights needed to anticipate, identify, and respond to threats, ensuring that security teams are always one step ahead of cyber adversaries.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "From November 2023 to April 2024, Insikt Group identified cyber-espionage activities conducted by RedJuliett, a likely Chinese state-sponsored group, primarily targeting government, academic, technology, and diplomatic organizations in Taiwan. RedJuliett exploited known vulnerabilities in network edge devices such as firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and load balancers for initial access. The group likely operates from Fuzhou, China, aligning with its persistent targeting of Taiwan. RedJulietts activities likely aim to support Beijing's intelligence collection on Taiwans economic and diplomatic relations, as well as critical technology development. \n\nChinese State-Sponsored RedJuliett Intensifies Cyber Espionage Against Taiwanese Government, Academic, and Technology Sectors\nRedJulietts focus on targeting Taiwanese entities aligns with the groups past activity. Insikt Group also observed RedJuliett expand its operations to compromise organizations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Laos, South Korea, the United States, Djibouti, Kenya, and Rwanda.\nIn addition to targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, RedJuliett also used structured query language (SQL) injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications. Organizations should complement routine patching with defense-in-depth strategies focused on detecting post-exploitation persistence, discovery, and lateral movement activity to counter these threats. Organizations should also regularly audit internet-facing devices and reduce their attack surface where possible. RedJuliett closely overlaps with public reporting under the aliases Flax Typhoon and Ethereal Panda.\n\nKey Findings\n\nVictim Organizations: RedJuliett compromised 24 organizations, including government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and Rwanda. The group also conducted network reconnaissance or attempted exploitation against over 70 academic, government, think tank, and technology organizations in Taiwan, as well as multiple de facto embassies operating on the island.\nExploitation Techniques: RedJuliett created a SoftEther VPN bridge or client in victim networks. Additionally, the group conducted reconnaissance and attempted exploitation activity using Acunetix Web Application Security Scanners. RedJuliett also attempted SQL injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications. Post-exploitation, the group used open-source web shells and exploited an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Linux operating system.\nInfrastructure: RedJuliett administers operational infrastructure using SoftEther VPN, leveraging both threat actor-controlled leased servers and compromised infrastructure belonging to Taiwanese universities.\nImplications for Taiwan: RedJuliett's activities align with Beijing's objectives to gather intelligence on Taiwans economic policy, trade, and diplomatic relations. The group also targeted multiple critical technology companies, highlighting the strategic importance of this sector for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors.\n\nRecommendations for Organizations\nOrganizations likely to be targeted by RedJuliett should adopt the following measures:\n\nNetwork Segmentation: Practice network segmentation by isolating internet-facing services in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).\nSecurity Monitoring: Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activities such as the use of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells and lateral movement within internal networks.\nReview Public Guidance: Review public guidance on mitigating common TTPs used by Chinese state-sponsored groups and Insikt Groups report on trends and recommendations for mitigating Chinese APT activity more broadly.\nRisk-Based Patching: Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those being exploited in the wild, as identified by Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence.\nPrioritize RCE Vulnerabilities: Focus on addressing remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in popular VPN, mail server, firewall, and load-balancing appliances, particularly F5 BIG-IP, Fortinet FortiGate, and ZyXEL ZyWALL devices.\nMalicious Traffic Analysis: Monitor Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) to proactively detect and alert on infrastructure communicating with known RedJuliett command-and-control (C2) IP addresses.\nMonitor Supply Chains: Use Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence to monitor real-time output and identify suspected intrusion activities involving key vendors and partners.\nThreat Intelligence Extension: Install the Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Browser Extension for instant access to threat intelligence from any web-based resource, enabling faster alert processing within security information and event management (SIEM) and prioritizing vulnerabilities for patching.\n\nInsikt Group anticipates that RedJuliett and other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors will continue to target Taiwan for intelligence-gathering, focusing on universities, government organizations, think tanks, and technology companies. Chinese state-sponsored groups are expected to continue their reconnaissance and exploitation of public-facing devices, a tactic that has proven effective in scaling their operations to gain initial access to a broad range of global targets. \nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nActive RedJuliett servers as of May 21, 2024:\n38.147.190[.]192 (since 2024-04-07)\n61.238.103[.]155 (since 2024-02-23)\n122.10.89[.]230 (since 2024-01-24)\n137.220.36[.]87 (since 2024-05-09)\n140.120.98[.]115 (since 2023-11-14)\n154.197.98[.]3 (since 2023-11-14)\n154.197.99[.]202 (since 2023-12-16)\n176.119.150[.]92 (since 2024-04-01)\n    \nKnown RedJuliett SoftEther TLS Certificates (SHA-1 Fingerprint)\n7992c0a816246b287d991c4ecf68f2d32e4bca18\n5437d0195c31bf7cedc9d90b8cb0074272bc55df\ncc1f0cdc131dfafd43f60ff0e6a6089cd03e92f1\n2c95b971aa47dc4d94a3c52db74a3de11d9ba658\n0cc0ba859981e0c8142a4877f3af99d98dc0b707\n9f01fc7cad8cdd8d934e2d2f033d7199a5e96e4a\n    \nDomains:\ncktime.ooguy[.]com\nwww.sofeter[.]ml\nwww.dns361[.]tk\n\n\n            \n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n  \n   Tactic: Technique   ATT&CK Code  \n  \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server   T1583.003  \n    \n   Resource Development: Compromise Infrastructure: Server   T1584  \n    \n   Reconnaissance: Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning   T1595.002  \n    \n   Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application   T1190  \n    \n   Persistence: External Remote Services   T1133  \n    \n   Persistence: Server Software Component: Web Shell   T1505.003  \n    \n   Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation   T1068",

After all, its mostly free, and who can say no to that?</p><p>Unfortunately, much like the other major subtypes  human intelligence, signals intelligence, and geospatial intelligence, to name a few  open source intelligence is widely misunderstood and misused.</p><p>This widespread use and the growing sophistication of OSINT are reflected in market projections. In fact, according to a <a href=\"https://futuremarketinsights.com/reports/open-source-intelligence-market\">report</a> by Future Market Insikt, the OSINT industry is predicted to reach a staggering $58 billion by 2033, highlighting its increasing importance and integration into various sectors.</p><p>If you have ever asked yourself What does OSINT stand for? What is open source intelligence (OSINT)? Or whats the OSINT meaning? Keep reading to find out.</p><p>In this blog post, were going to cover <strong>the fundamentals of Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT</strong>, including how its used, and the <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/tactical-threat-intelligence\">tools and techniques</a> that can be employed to gather and analyze it. Well delve into what is OSINT, exploring the OSINT meaning and the significant role it plays in the realm of intelligence gathering.</p><h2 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li><strong>Open source intelligence is derived from data and information that is available to the general public</strong>. Its not limited to what can be found using Google, although the so-called surface web is an important component.</li><li><strong>As valuable as open source intelligence can be, information overload is a real concern</strong>. Most of the tools and techniques used to conduct open source intelligence initiatives are designed to help security professionals (or threat actors) focus their efforts on specific areas of interest.</li><li><strong>There is a dark side to open source intelligence: anything that can be found by security professionals can also be found (and used) by threat actors</strong>.</li><li><strong>Having a clear strategy and framework in place for open source intelligence gathering is essential</strong>  simply looking for anything that could be interesting or useful will inevitably lead to burnout.</li><li><strong>Using OSINT tools to discover and protect sensitive data from potential attackers is crucial</strong> to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li></ul><h2 id=\"osint-meaning\">OSINT Meaning</h2><p>Before we look at common sources and applications of open source intelligence, its important to understand what it actually is.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap15-subchapI-sec403-5.htm\">According</a> to U.S. public law, open source intelligence:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Is produced from publicly available information</strong></li><li><strong>Is collected, analyzed, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience</strong></li><li><strong>Addresses a specific intelligence requirement</strong></li></ul><p>The important phrase to focus on here is publicly available.</p><p><strong>The term open source refers specifically to information that is available for public consumption</strong>. If any specialist skills, tools, or techniques are required to access a piece of information, it cant reasonably be considered open source.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/what_is_osint_definition_0d760cc7c0.webp\" alt=\"What is OSINT? (Open Source Intelligence)\"></p><br><p>Crucially, open source information is not limited to what you can find using the major search engines. Web pages and other resources that can be found using Google certainly constitute massive sources of open source information, but they are far from the only sources.</p><p>For starters, a huge proportion of the internet (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=_V8MGzvJEXY\">over 99 percent, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt</a>) cannot be found using the major search engines. This so-called deep web is a mass of websites, databases, files, and more that (for a variety of reasons, including the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dangers-of-exposed-login-panels\">presence of login pages</a> or paywalls) cannot be indexed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any other search engine you care to think of. Despite this, much of the content of the deep web can be considered open source because its readily available to the public.</p><p><strong>OSINT tools can be used to access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines</strong>. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, gather and analyze massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.</p><p>In addition, <strong>theres plenty of freely accessible information online that can be found using online tools other than traditional search engines</strong>. Well look at this more later on, but as a simple example, tools like <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/\">SecurityTrails</a> and others can be used to find IP addresses, networks, open ports, webcams, printers, and pretty much anything else thats connected to the internet.</p><p><strong>Information can also be considered open source if it is:</strong></p><ul><li>Published or broadcast for a public audience (for example, news media content)</li><li>Available to the public by request (for example, census data)</li><li>Available to the public by subscription or purchase (for example, industry journals)</li><li>Could be seen or heard by any casual observer</li><li>Made available at a meeting open to the public</li><li>Obtained by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the public</li></ul><p>At this point, youre probably thinking, Man, thats a lot of information </p><p>And youre right. Were talking about a truly unimaginable quantity of information that is growing at a far higher rate than anybody could ever hope to keep up with. Even if we narrow the field down to a single source of information  lets say Twitter  were forced to cope with <a href=\"http://internetlivestats.com/\">hundreds of millions of new data points every day</a>.</p><p>This, as youve probably gathered, is the inherent trade-off of open source intelligence.</p><h2 id=\"history-of-osint\">History of OSINT</h2><p>The term OSINT refers to the practice of collecting information from <a href=\"https://osintfoundation.com/osint/Standards.asp\">publicly available sources</a> to be used in an intelligence context. This practice has been around for a while, but its the digital era that really propelled OSINT into a league of its own.</p><p><strong>The foundational roots of OSINT are linked to the formation of the <a href=\"https://cia.gov/readingroom/sites/default/files/FBIS_history_part1_0.pdf\">Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) back in 1941</a></strong>. This organization was charged with the significant role of scrutinizing international broadcast communications to identify any potential dubious activities.</p><p><a href=\"https://afio.com/publications/Schauer_Storger_Evo_of_OSINT_WINTERSPRING2013.pdf\">According</a> to the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO): <strong>The US military first coined the term OSINT in the late 1980s.</strong> This development stemmed from the recognition that intelligence reform was needed to effectively meet the rapidly changing informational demands, particularly at the tactical battlefield level.</p><p>Initially, OSINT was a tool used primarily by intelligence agencies and law enforcement to gather publicly available information to assist in national security and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/cybercriminals\">cybercriminal</a> investigations. The methods involved were time-consuming, often requiring individuals to manually sift through public records, newspapers, and other documents to find relevant information. This manual gathering of information was often difficult due to the vast amount of data one had to sift through. However, <strong>as the web evolved, so did the methods of collecting and analyzing publicly available data</strong>.</p><p>The advent of the internet significantly amplified the means through which information could be collected. <strong>Suddenly, a wide range of data became publicly available and easily accessible online, from government reports to academic papers, and everything in-between</strong>. Websites became a primary data source for OSINT practitioners. These developments led to a boom in the creation of <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/tools-and-technologies/osint-tools\">OSINT tools</a> designed to automate the process of data collection and analysis. These tools could quickly gather information from various sources, including publicly accessible databases, social media platforms, and many other tools available in the digital realm.</p><p><strong>As the field of cybersecurity experienced rapid growth, the application of OSINT expanded. Cybersecurity professionals began to see the value in utilizing OSINT to identify vulnerabilities, assess potential security threats, and bolster organizational security</strong>. OSINT tools became essential in monitoring publicly accessible web servers, analyzing metadata, and assessing security vulnerabilities. The data gathered became invaluable in understanding the security posture of an organization, identifying potential threats, and developing strategies to mitigate risks.</p><p>One notable trend is <strong>the integration of machine learning and analytics in OSINT tools to enhance the process of identifying patterns and trends from the collected data</strong>. This integration has not only made OSINT tools more effective but has also expanded the range of applications in which they can be utilized. For instance, security researchers now use OSINT to perform penetration tests, while businesses use it to gain insights into their competitors and the market environment.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>the community of OSINT researchers has grown over time, with forums, conferences, and groups forming to share knowledge, discuss best practices, and develop new OSINT techniques</strong>. Many OSINT tools, including frameworks like Recon-ng, have communities of developers on platforms like GitHub, working to improve, customize, and create modules to extend the capabilities of these tools. The collective effort of these communities has played a significant role in refining the OSINT practice, making it a vital component in intelligence gathering and cybersecurity.</p><h2 id=\"how-is-open-source-intelligence-used\">How Is Open Source Intelligence Used?</h2><p>Now that weve covered the basics of open source intelligence, we can look at <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/open-source-intelligence-future\">how it is commonly used for cybersecurity</a>. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. </p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_how_is_open_source_intelligence_used_991120581e.webp\" alt=\"How is Open Source Intelligence Used?\"></p><br><p>There are two common use cases:</p><h3 id=\"1-ethical-hacking-and-penetration-testing\">1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing</h3><p>Security professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors. Commonly found weaknesses include:</p><ul><li>Accidental leaks of sensitive data, like through <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/social-media-threat-intelligence\">social media</a>. Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li><li>Open ports or unsecured internet-connected devices</li><li>Unpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products</li><li>Leaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-identifying-external-threats\">2. Identifying External Threats</h3><p>As weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats\">emerging threats</a>. From identifying which new <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/exploiting-old-vulnerabilities\">vulnerabilities are being actively exploited</a> to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.</p><p>In most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation. For example, while a single threatening tweet may not be cause for concern, that same tweet would be viewed in a different light if it were tied to a threat group known to be active in a specific industry.</p><p>One of the most important things to understand about open source intelligence is that it is often used in combination with other intelligence subtypes. Intelligence from closed sources such as internal telemetry, closed <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-networks\">dark web communities</a>, and external intelligence-sharing communities is regularly used to filter and verify open source intelligence. There are a variety of tools available to help analysts perform these functions, which well look at a bit later on.</p><h2 id=\"the-dark-side-of-open-source-intelligence\">The Dark Side of Open Source Intelligence</h2><p>At this point, its time to address the second major issue with open source intelligence: <strong>if something is readily available to intelligence analysts, its also readily available to threat actors.</strong></p><p><strong>Threat actors use open source intelligence tools and techniques to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses in target networks.</strong> Once a vulnerability is identified, it is often an <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-i-hacked-40-websites-in-7-minutes-5b4c28bc8824\">extremely quick and simple process</a> to exploit it and achieve a variety of malicious objectives. They also seek out sensitive data that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as launching targeted attacks or selling the information on the dark web.</p><p>This process is the main reason why so many small and medium-sized enterprises get hacked each year. It isnt because threat groups specifically take an interest in them, but rather because vulnerabilities in their network or website architecture are found using simple open source intelligence techniques. In short, they are easy targets.</p><p>And open source intelligence doesnt only enable technical attacks on IT systems and networks. <strong>Different <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">types of threat actors</a> also seek out information about individuals and organizations that can be used to inform sophisticated social engineering campaigns using <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/podcast-episode-31\">phishing</a> (email), vishing (phone or voicemail), and SMiShing (SMS).</strong> Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.</p><p>This is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information <em>before</em> a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.</p><h2 id=\"open-source-intelligence-techniques-and-osint-tools\">Open Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools</h2><p>Now that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_techniques_c41b559086.webp\" alt=\"OSINT Techniques\"></p><br><p>First, <strong>you must have a clear strategy and <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/analytical-threat-intelligence-frameworks\">framework</a> in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information from publicly available sources to address specific intelligence requirements.\nOf all the threat intelligence subtypes, open source intelligence (OSINT) is perhaps the most widely used, which makes sense. After all, its mostly free, and who can say no to that?\nUnfortunately, much like the other major subtypes  human intelligence, signals intelligence, and geospatial intelligence, to name a few  open source intelligence is widely misunderstood and misused.\nThis widespread use and the growing sophistication of OSINT are reflected in market projections. In fact, according to a report by Future Market Insikt, the OSINT industry is predicted to reach a staggering $58 billion by 2033, highlighting its increasing importance and integration into various sectors.\nIf you have ever asked yourself What does OSINT stand for? What is open source intelligence (OSINT)? Or whats the OSINT meaning? Keep reading to find out.\nIn this blog post, were going to cover the fundamentals of Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT, including how its used, and the tools and techniques that can be employed to gather and analyze it. Well delve into what is OSINT, exploring the OSINT meaning and the significant role it plays in the realm of intelligence gathering.\nKey Takeaways\n\nOpen source intelligence is derived from data and information that is available to the general public. Its not limited to what can be found using Google, although the so-called surface web is an important component.\nAs valuable as open source intelligence can be, information overload is a real concern. Most of the tools and techniques used to conduct open source intelligence initiatives are designed to help security professionals (or threat actors) focus their efforts on specific areas of interest.\nThere is a dark side to open source intelligence: anything that can be found by security professionals can also be found (and used) by threat actors.\nHaving a clear strategy and framework in place for open source intelligence gathering is essential  simply looking for anything that could be interesting or useful will inevitably lead to burnout.\nUsing OSINT tools to discover and protect sensitive data from potential attackers is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.\n\nOSINT Meaning\nBefore we look at common sources and applications of open source intelligence, its important to understand what it actually is.\nAccording to U.S. public law, open source intelligence:\n\nIs produced from publicly available information\nIs collected, analyzed, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience\nAddresses a specific intelligence requirement\n\nThe important phrase to focus on here is publicly available.\nThe term open source refers specifically to information that is available for public consumption. If any specialist skills, tools, or techniques are required to access a piece of information, it cant reasonably be considered open source.\n\n\n\nCrucially, open source information is not limited to what you can find using the major search engines. Web pages and other resources that can be found using Google certainly constitute massive sources of open source information, but they are far from the only sources.\nFor starters, a huge proportion of the internet (over 99 percent, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt) cannot be found using the major search engines. This so-called deep web is a mass of websites, databases, files, and more that (for a variety of reasons, including the presence of login pages or paywalls) cannot be indexed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any other search engine you care to think of. Despite this, much of the content of the deep web can be considered open source because its readily available to the public.\nOSINT tools can be used to access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, gather and analyze massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.\nIn addition, theres plenty of freely accessible information online that can be found using online tools other than traditional search engines. Well look at this more later on, but as a simple example, tools like SecurityTrails and others can be used to find IP addresses, networks, open ports, webcams, printers, and pretty much anything else thats connected to the internet.\nInformation can also be considered open source if it is:\n\nPublished or broadcast for a public audience (for example, news media content)\nAvailable to the public by request (for example, census data)\nAvailable to the public by subscription or purchase (for example, industry journals)\nCould be seen or heard by any casual observer\nMade available at a meeting open to the public\nObtained by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the public\n\nAt this point, youre probably thinking, Man, thats a lot of information \nAnd youre right. Were talking about a truly unimaginable quantity of information that is growing at a far higher rate than anybody could ever hope to keep up with. Even if we narrow the field down to a single source of information  lets say Twitter  were forced to cope with hundreds of millions of new data points every day.\nThis, as youve probably gathered, is the inherent trade-off of open source intelligence.\nHistory of OSINT\nThe term OSINT refers to the practice of collecting information from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. This practice has been around for a while, but its the digital era that really propelled OSINT into a league of its own.\nThe foundational roots of OSINT are linked to the formation of the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) back in 1941. This organization was charged with the significant role of scrutinizing international broadcast communications to identify any potential dubious activities.\nAccording to the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO): The US military first coined the term OSINT in the late 1980s. This development stemmed from the recognition that intelligence reform was needed to effectively meet the rapidly changing informational demands, particularly at the tactical battlefield level.\nInitially, OSINT was a tool used primarily by intelligence agencies and law enforcement to gather publicly available information to assist in national security and cybercriminal investigations. The methods involved were time-consuming, often requiring individuals to manually sift through public records, newspapers, and other documents to find relevant information. This manual gathering of information was often difficult due to the vast amount of data one had to sift through. However, as the web evolved, so did the methods of collecting and analyzing publicly available data.\nThe advent of the internet significantly amplified the means through which information could be collected. Suddenly, a wide range of data became publicly available and easily accessible online, from government reports to academic papers, and everything in-between. Websites became a primary data source for OSINT practitioners. These developments led to a boom in the creation of OSINT tools designed to automate the process of data collection and analysis. These tools could quickly gather information from various sources, including publicly accessible databases, social media platforms, and many other tools available in the digital realm.\nAs the field of cybersecurity experienced rapid growth, the application of OSINT expanded. Cybersecurity professionals began to see the value in utilizing OSINT to identify vulnerabilities, assess potential security threats, and bolster organizational security. OSINT tools became essential in monitoring publicly accessible web servers, analyzing metadata, and assessing security vulnerabilities. The data gathered became invaluable in understanding the security posture of an organization, identifying potential threats, and developing strategies to mitigate risks.\nOne notable trend is the integration of machine learning and analytics in OSINT tools to enhance the process of identifying patterns and trends from the collected data. This integration has not only made OSINT tools more effective but has also expanded the range of applications in which they can be utilized. For instance, security researchers now use OSINT to perform penetration tests, while businesses use it to gain insights into their competitors and the market environment.\nMoreover, the community of OSINT researchers has grown over time, with forums, conferences, and groups forming to share knowledge, discuss best practices, and develop new OSINT techniques. Many OSINT tools, including frameworks like Recon-ng, have communities of developers on platforms like GitHub, working to improve, customize, and create modules to extend the capabilities of these tools. The collective effort of these communities has played a significant role in refining the OSINT practice, making it a vital component in intelligence gathering and cybersecurity.\nHow Is Open Source Intelligence Used?\nNow that weve covered the basics of open source intelligence, we can look at how it is commonly used for cybersecurity. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. \n\n\n\nThere are two common use cases:\n1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing\nSecurity professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors. Commonly found weaknesses include:\n\nAccidental leaks of sensitive data, like through social media. Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.\nOpen ports or unsecured internet-connected devices\nUnpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products\nLeaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins\n\n2. Identifying External Threats\nAs weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing emerging threats. From identifying which new vulnerabilities are being actively exploited to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.\nIn most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation. For example, while a single threatening tweet may not be cause for concern, that same tweet would be viewed in a different light if it were tied to a threat group known to be active in a specific industry.\nOne of the most important things to understand about open source intelligence is that it is often used in combination with other intelligence subtypes. Intelligence from closed sources such as internal telemetry, closed dark web communities, and external intelligence-sharing communities is regularly used to filter and verify open source intelligence. There are a variety of tools available to help analysts perform these functions, which well look at a bit later on.\nThe Dark Side of Open Source Intelligence\nAt this point, its time to address the second major issue with open source intelligence: if something is readily available to intelligence analysts, its also readily available to threat actors.\nThreat actors use open source intelligence tools and techniques to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses in target networks. Once a vulnerability is identified, it is often an extremely quick and simple process to exploit it and achieve a variety of malicious objectives. They also seek out sensitive data that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as launching targeted attacks or selling the information on the dark web.\nThis process is the main reason why so many small and medium-sized enterprises get hacked each year. It isnt because threat groups specifically take an interest in them, but rather because vulnerabilities in their network or website architecture are found using simple open source intelligence techniques. In short, they are easy targets.\nAnd open source intelligence doesnt only enable technical attacks on IT systems and networks. Different types of threat actors also seek out information about individuals and organizations that can be used to inform sophisticated social engineering campaigns using phishing (email), vishing (phone or voicemail), and SMiShing (SMS). Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.\nThis is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information before a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.\nOpen Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools\nNow that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.\n\n\n\nFirst, you must have a clear strategy and framework in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence. Its not recommended to approach open source intelligence from the perspective of finding anything and everything that might be interesting or useful  as weve already discussed, the sheer volume of information available through open sources will simply overwhelm you.\nIt is also crucial to select the right OSINT tool for your specific intelligence gathering goals. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, can help discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.\nInstead, you must know exactly what youre trying to achieve  for example, to identify and remediate weaknesses in your network  and focus your energies specifically on accomplishing those goals.\nSecond, you must identify a set of tools and techniques for collecting and processing open source information. Once again, the volume of information available is much too great for manual processes to be even slightly effective.\nPassive vs. Active OSINT\nBroadly speaking, collection of open source intelligence falls into two categories: passive collection and active collection.\nPassive collection often involves the use of threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) to combine a variety of threat feeds into a single, easily accessible location. While this is a major step up from manual intelligence harvesting, the risk of information overload is still significant.\nMore advanced threat intelligence solutions like Recorded Future solve this problem by using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to automate the process of prioritizing and dismissing alerts based on an organizations specific needs. Additionally, using an OSINT tool can further streamline this process by gathering and analyzing massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web.\nIn a similar manner, organized threat groups often use botnets to collect valuable information using techniques like traffic sniffing and keylogging.\nActive collection is the use of a variety of techniques to search for specific insights or information. For security professionals, this type of collection work is usually done for one of two reasons:\n\nA passively collected alert has highlighted a potential threat and further insight is required.\nThe focus of an intelligence gathering exercise is very specific, such as a penetration testing exercise.\n\nTo close things out, well take a look at some of the most commonly used tools for collecting and processing open source intelligence.\nWhile there are many free and useful tools available to security professionals and threat actors alike, some of the most commonly used (and abused) open source intelligence tools are search engines like Google  just not as most of us know them.\nAs weve already explained, one of the biggest issues facing security professionals is the regularity with which normal, well-meaning users accidentally leave sensitive assets and information exposed to the internet. There are a series of advanced search functions called Google dork queries that can be used to identify the information and assets they expose.\nGoogle dork queries are based on the search operators used by IT professionals and hackers on a daily basis to conduct their work. Common examples include filetype:, which narrows search results to a specific file type, and site:, which only returns results from a specified website or domain.\nThe Public Intelligence website offers a more thorough rundown of Google dork queries, in which they give the following example search:\nsensitive but unclassified filetype:pdf site:publicintelligence.net\nIf you type this search term into a search engine, it returns only PDF documents from the Public Intelligence website that contain the words sensitive but unclassified somewhere in the document text. As you can imagine, with hundreds of commands at their disposal, security professionals and threat actors can use similar techniques to search for almost anything.\nMoving beyond search engines, there are literally hundreds of tools that can be used to identify network weaknesses or exposed assets. For example, you can use Wappalyzer to identify which technologies are used on a website, and combine the results with Sploitus or the National Vulnerability Database to determine whether any relevant vulnerabilities exist. Taking things a step further, you could use a more advanced threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future to determine whether any recent vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, or included in any active exploit kits.\nOSINT FAQ\nIs OSINT legal?\nYes, OSINT is generally legal since it involves gathering information that is publicly available. However, the legality can become a gray area depending on how the information is used or if attempts are made to access restricted or private data under the guise of OSINT. It is crucial to ensure that while gathering information, sensitive data is protected to prevent it from being exploited by attackers.\nWhat is the dark side of OSINT?\nThe dark side of OSINT emerges when sensitive data is gathered and misused for malicious purposes.

This lucrative rate is likely to attract seasoned affiliates from other platforms, leading to a surge in RansomHub-related infections and victims.\nSince its launch, RansomHub has claimed 45 victims across 18 countries, with the IT sector being the most frequently targeted. This pattern suggests that RansomHubs affiliates are engaging in big game hunting, where attackers focus on high-value targets that are more likely to pay substantial ransoms due to the severe financial implications of operational downtime.\nIn one notable incident, RansomHub affiliates leveraged misconfigured Amazon S3 instances to access backups not only of their primary target but also of other clients using the same backup provider. This tactic allowed them to extort the backup solutions provider by threatening to leak client data, exploiting the trust relationship between providers and their clients. Recently, RansomHub gained attention for selling 4TB of data stolen from Change Healthcare, a US-based healthcare technology company.\nInsikt Groups analysis revealed code overlaps between RansomHub and other ransomware groups, such as ALPHV (BlackCat) and Knight Ransomware. These similarities suggest possible connections or shared resources among these groups. RansomHubs strategy of using passwords to decrypt embedded configurations makes it challenging for threat researchers to analyze the malware dynamically.\nRansomHubs ESXi version employs a unique tactic by creating a file named /tmp/app.pid to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously. Modifying this file can halt the ransomwares operations, presenting a potential mitigation strategy for affected systems.\nMitigations\nInsikt Group has created YARA and Sigma rules that can be used to detect the presence or execution of RansomHub ransomware files in your environment. These rules cover ESXi, Linux, and Windows variants. Additionally, analysts can search endpoint logging for command-line invocations used by RansomHub to stop virtual machines (VMs), delete shadow copies, and stop the Internet Information Service (IIS) service.\n\npowershell.exe -Command PowerShell -Command \"\"Get-VM | Stop-VM -Force\"\"\ncmd.exe /c iisreset.exe /stop\npowershell.exe -Command PowerShell -Command \"\"Get-CimInstance Win32_ShadowCopy | Remove-CimInstance\"\"\n\nIn addition to the above detections, the following general recommendations should be followed to reduce the risk of ransomware infections effectively\n\nNetwork Isolation: Segment your network to limit ransomware's lateral movement.\nSIEM: Implement Security Information and Event Management for centralized logging and detection.\nEndpoint Detection: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) services with YARA and Sigma rules.\nLeast Privilege Access: Implement least privilege access and multi-factor authentication for remote access services.\nData Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up data and store backups offline or in isolated segments.\nEvaluate Solutions Providers: Collaborate with providers for consistent system audits.\nPatch Management: Keep all applications and operating systems up to date with the latest patches and updates.\nRecorded Future Hunting Packages: Implement YARA and Sigma rules like the ones found in Recorded Future Hunting Packages to identify malware via signature-based detection or Snort rules for endpoint-based detections.\n\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

Headlace malware is deployed using phishing emails, sometimes mimicking legitimate communications to increase effectiveness. BlueDelta exploits legitimate internet services (LIS) and living off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), further disguising their operations within regular network traffic. This sophistication makes detection difficult, increasing BlueDeltas success when compromising networks.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2024_0514_Blue_delta_Report_infographic_Figure_8_a519d307c2.webp\" alt=\"2024_0514 - Blue delta Report infographic_Figure 8.webp\"></p><p>One notable aspect of BlueDeltas operations is its focus on credential harvesting pages.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Insikt Group tracks the evolutions of GRU's BlueDelta operational infrastructure, targeting networks across Europe with information-stealing Headlace malware and credential-harvesting web pages. BlueDelta deployed Headlace infrastructure in three distinct phases from April to December 2023, using phishing, compromised internet services, and living off the land binaries to extract intelligence. Credential harvesting pages targeted Ukraine's Ministry of Defence, European transportation infrastructures, and an Azerbaijani think tank, reflecting a broader Russian strategy to influence regional and military dynamics.\n\nGRU's BlueDelta Espionage Campaigns Across Europe\nRussias strategic military intelligence unit, the GRU, continues to conduct sophisticated cyber-espionage operations as geopolitical tensions persist. Insikt Groups latest findings highlight the actions of BlueDelta, which has systematically targeted key networks across Europe using custom malware and credential harvesting.\nFrom April to December 2023, BlueDelta deployed Headlace malware in three distinct phases using geofencing techniques to target networks throughout Europe with a heavy focus on Ukraine. Headlace malware is deployed using phishing emails, sometimes mimicking legitimate communications to increase effectiveness. BlueDelta exploits legitimate internet services (LIS) and living off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), further disguising their operations within regular network traffic. This sophistication makes detection difficult, increasing BlueDeltas success when compromising networks.\n\nOne notable aspect of BlueDeltas operations is its focus on credential harvesting pages. Targeting services like Yahoo and UKR[.]net, it employs advanced functions capable of relaying two-factor authentication and CAPTCHA challenges. Recent operations have targeted the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, Ukrainian weapons import and export companies, European railway infrastructure, and a think tank based in Azerbaijan. \nSuccessfully infiltrating networks associated with Ukraines Ministry of Defence and European railway systems could allow BlueDelta to gather intelligence that potentially shapes battlefield tactics and broader military strategies. Moreover, BlueDeltas interest in the Azerbaijan Center for Economic and Social Development suggests an agenda to understand and possibly influence regional policies.\nFor organizations within government, military, defense, and related sectors, the rise of BlueDeltas activities is a call to bolster cybersecurity measures: prioritizing the detection of sophisticated phishing attempts, restricting access to non-essential internet services, and enhancing surveillance of critical network infrastructure. Continuous cybersecurity training to recognize and respond to advanced threats is essential to defend against such state-level adversaries.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

Then I decided that I wanted a more secure  pun intended  career path that didnt hinge on my creative output. I sub-majored in network security in university and took a chance on a cybersecurity graduate position, which I really ended up liking. Ive kind of been doing both ever since. </p><h3 id=\"whats-your-role-at-canva\">Whats your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Zito) I lead the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team.

While interviewing, I had some candid discussions with the head of security at the time, and we both agreed it didnt make sense for there to be any dedicated CTI capability without a mature detection and response team first. Theres honestly no point in threat intelligence if theres no way to action it, and to do that you need a solid incident response team as your foundation. Imagine flipping over all these rocks and theres no-one around to deal with the spiders!</p><p>After a year or two, we felt we were ready to build out a CTI program, which weve done from scratch.  While weve made a huge amount of progress, were still a very lean team and Im still on a bit of everything train: I engineer our collections, automation and intelligence sharing infrastructure; maintain intelligence requirements and alerting use cases; still tag-team on incidents where intelligence analysis can benefit; and design ways for strategic threat intelligence to make its way to the right areas of the business.</p><h3 id=\"to-bianca-forbes-how-did-you-get-started-in-cybersecurity-and-what-is-your-role-at-canva\">(To Bianca Forbes) How did you get started in cybersecurity? And what is your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Bianca Forbes) I actually started out in penetration testing, which I did for three years, before moving into cyber threat intelligence. When I first got into CTI, I didnt know much about it. After getting thrown in the deep end, I came to really enjoy researching and tracking adversaries as well as the contacts in the intelligence community that I made. Ive been doing it ever since.</p><p>At Canva, I help run the CTI program with Jasmina. I focus primarily on intelligence operations: tracking adversaries, reporting on trends in the threat landscape, providing analysis expertise in investigations, and crafting threat hunting packages.</p><h3 id=\"how-did-you-get-buy-in-for-building-a-cyber-threat-intelligence-cti-program-why-should-other-companies-consider-investing-in-threat-intelligence\">How did you get buy-in for building a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program? Why should other companies consider investing in threat intelligence?</h3><p>(Zito) To use an industry buzzword  CTI really helps security teams shift left. Traditionally, without CTI, you may be detecting and responding to threats using only the information you have from within your own network. Youre looking for something bad but youre not always sure what, how, or when. </p><p><strong>In my mind, once you detect a threat, you&#39;ve already got it in your environment. Its too late. It&#39;s already happened.</strong></p><p>I think what really helped me get buy-in was to actually start producing CTI products to showcase their value. At the heart of it, the value of threat intelligence is influencing: you use your deliverables to convince the business to do something, whether its investing in a capability, changing the way something is done, or paying more attention to an identified risk. </p><p>You obviously have to start small and be very curated when you dont have dedicated resources. Ive seen it go wrong when emerging teams simply rehash the news or flick on all the threat feeds, which causes a lot of frustration for the people who have to do extra work as a result of the onslaught of new, incoming information. You have to start somewhere but you also have to know what you want out of it all. This is where threat modeling can help. Understanding your organizations crown jewels and what the risks are (your intelligence requirements) helps you be more strategic about where to start.</p><p>In my talk at Recorded Future Predict23 in Singapore, I mentioned a few tips based on lessons learned over time.</p><p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> Instead of sending out daily security news summaries to a mailing list, try referencing a security report in an action item sent directly to the team who can remediate a specific security risk. </p><p>Being that filter between all the sensationalized articles and what your organization actually needs to action helped us build rapport and trust between teams. If you meet your peers halfway, actually read the report and try to make a call on what needs to be done and by whom, youve reduced a lot of mental labor for everyone involved. An added bonus is that you subconsciously train folks to pay attention to when you send them something, otherwise I wager pretty strongly that those daily digests are going to end up in the junk pile a lot of the time.</p><p><strong>Tip #2:</strong> Instead of turning on threat intelligence modules and data feeds in all of your security tools, try only ingesting high-fidelity observables that directly map to a threat youre concerned about. </p><p>That doesnt mean you need to intentionally miss out on a bunch of data during collections. Something Bianca and I have built out is kind of like a tier-based system. All of the observables from our commercial and open source come into the threat intelligence platform (TIP), and they actually all go to the SIEM as well, but that doesnt mean they all are treated the same way. The bulk, raw data is used for enrichment and historical referencing. Then, as part of our usual operational cadence, we will research and validate a subset of observables that meet our intelligence requirements. </p><p>Based on our research, well add extra context and metadata to those observables and intentionally mark them as curated so that they become active in our security tools and can be used in detection or prevention rules. This way, we combat the perception that CTI is just a stream of low-fidelity observables that cause a lot of noise and alert fatigue. </p><p>Once we had that foundation of trust and confidence in the value and fidelity of the curated data, we could then weigh in on the detection engineering process by providing expertise on what metadata can be used  out of the remaining uncurated observable data  to satisfy specific detection use cases.</p><h3 id=\"as-youre-putting-together-your-cyber-threat-intelligence-function-what-kind-of-information-is-needed\">As you&#39;re putting together your Cyber Threat Intelligence function, what kind of information is needed?</h3><p>(Zito) Once you&#39;ve got your intelligence requirements  pick three to start off with and then work back from there you could ask yourself:</p><ul><li>What information do I need to answer those questions? </li><li>Is it open source information? Is it commercial intelligence? A mixture of both?</li><li>What data do I need?  How will I then consume that data? </li><li>Do I have a threat intelligence platform?</li></ul><p>You need to figure out where you&#39;re going to put all of that information, and understand whether you have the technical capability to actually manage all of that infrastructure yourself. If you&#39;re a small team and you don&#39;t have a lot of engineering resources, maybe you&#39;ll actually start off with something commercial and buy instead of build so you dont have to think about managing infrastructure and can instead focus on actual analysis.</p><p>It can be tempting to get started using open source tooling. I love that theres passionate people out there collectively building free tools to help with CTI operations. I would be cautious here about the time and skills needed to maintain some of these systems, as they can require a bit of TLC and jerry-rigging. Again, starting small and being intentional about your desired outcome is your best shot at incremental success.</p><p>When it comes to people, there are a lot of varying skills among CTI practitioners. For example, because of Bianca&#39;s pentesting background, shes very technically proficient and good at researching how adversary TTPs evolve; and there are other folks who specialize in what I would call more traditional intelligence analysis. It really just depends on your organization and what&#39;s going to work best to satisfy your intelligence requirements.  </p><p>If, like Canva, your organization is tech and software-centric, maybe its important you have people with the technical ability to understand how the latest obscure exploit could actually impact you, if at all. Whereas, if you are in critical infrastructure, maybe you need a bit more of that geopolitical background to help you understand which APT groups are a threat to your organization by understanding why somebody would try to come after critical infrastructure in the first place. </p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-think-about-connecting-your-people-tools-and-workflows\">How do you think about connecting your people, tools and workflows?</h3><p>(Zito) If you think about the teams consuming your intelligence products as customers, you need to understand their ways of working, their pain points, and what they need from you to support them. I usually pick one customer at a time, and pilot a workflow end-to-end based after sitting down with them and understanding <strong><em>their</em></strong> requirements.</p><p>If youre into games, pretend this is a role-playing game (RPG) and youre the support class. Your job is throwing heals and buffs. Youre likely not on the front lines in the heat of the battle, so its not really fair if you insist on calling all the shots.</p><p>If you use your blue team / SOC as an example first customer, they very likely have their own tooling for detections, their own case management system to house investigations and incidents, and their own internal comms channels. Nobody wants to receive an email with an attached report that has a bunch of random observables listed at the end in no particular format, that they then have to manually put into a system. What a waste of time!</p><p>When you talk to your blue team, you may learn that if they could have anything they wanted, it would be for someone to do all that for them and to not have to think about it. Theres no real reason they need to read a report for the threat to be blocked. If they need context, theyll be able to find it <strong>if</strong> an alert ever triggers. </p><p>Unfortunately, we (CTI) really dont want to be copy-paste robots either. So we automate. In cases where the analysis has already been done and all we need to do is block some hashes or C2 IPs, why does anyone have to be involved in the process? CTI should be able to click a button to validate an observable, and based on metadata, it goes where it needs to go. Thats essentially what we ended up building. </p><p>And that actually means now that when an intelligence report is published, its much more likely to be read, because the last one wasnt just a day ago. <strong>We want people to feel confident that silence from us equals no threat to worry about.</strong></p><p>(Forbes) A good example of an integrated workflow with Recorded Future is how we develop threat hunting packages. Our team is continually tracking trends in the threat landscape and we have processes to help us identify what is relevant to us. Reflecting back on the idea behind the tier-based system we have for observables, we consume all of the threat hunting packages Recorded Future publishes. Once we identify a threat trend we want to hunt for, we can use the relevant ingested packages as a building block for the final deliverable. Its especially helpful considering they come with YARA rules and TTPs, so it reduces some of the manual work we have to do. </p><p>Once a hunting package is developed, weve built an automated message that sends all the relevant information to the threat hunting team, again, integrating with their workflow and tooling. Another benefit of working closely with our customers when designing integrations is we can get valuable feedback about the outcomes of our intelligence products.</p><p>Another example workflow is how we mitigate risks associated with our supply chain vendors. By populating our suppliers watch list within Recorded Future, we can then look for things like who&#39;s attacking our suppliers. An example would be if one of our critical vendors has been posted on a ransomware blog site. Oftentimes we&#39;ll learn about that through Recorded Future before the vendor even reaches out and says, Hey, we&#39;ve had an incident. Yeah, we know we&#39;ve been watching. Recorded Future allows us to get on the front foot in those types of situations.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-showcase-the-value-that-youre-bringing-to-the-rest-of-the-security-organization-and-to-the-rest-of-the-company\">How do you showcase the value that youre bringing to the rest of the security organization? And to the rest of the company?</h3><p>(Zito) We track the fidelity of our deliverables by showing how much information and data we consume and how much of that turned into some kind of action. </p><p>For example, if we pulled in 100 threat reports; shortlisted 20 based on the topic meeting our intelligence requirements; and only 3 turned into an internal threat bulletin with recommended actions - thats actually a good thing. It shows that we filtered and curated information really well before it got on anyones to-do list.</p><p>It doesnt stop at recommendations or information shared, though. We also want to know how much of the work we have generated for other teams resulted in something useful. If we published a threat hunting package and no malicious activity was uncovered, thats great. But what else did we discover? Were there any new detection ideas as a result? Is there any additional telemetry that we could monitor? </p><p>When we&#39;re talking about showing value to the broader organization, it&#39;s really about taking the macro trends from all of those metrics and surfacing it into high level insights. Imagine if you started out thinking malware was your biggest threat because thats what your industrys threat landscape is telling you. </p><p>Once you start collecting data about the outcomes of your intelligence products  What category of observables triggered the most alerts? How many threat bulletins resulted in a security investigation and subsequent uplift, and in what areas? </p><p>You may learn your biggest threat is something entirely different. Or, if you dont, at least the data validates your current assessment. Either way, this can help you drive your overall security strategy by supporting continued investment into existing focus areas or highlighting areas that may need more attention.</p>",

It's already happened.\nI think what really helped me get buy-in was to actually start producing CTI products to showcase their value. At the heart of it, the value of threat intelligence is influencing: you use your deliverables to convince the business to do something, whether its investing in a capability, changing the way something is done, or paying more attention to an identified risk. \nYou obviously have to start small and be very curated when you dont have dedicated resources. Ive seen it go wrong when emerging teams simply rehash the news or flick on all the threat feeds, which causes a lot of frustration for the people who have to do extra work as a result of the onslaught of new, incoming information. You have to start somewhere but you also have to know what you want out of it all. This is where threat modeling can help. Understanding your organizations crown jewels and what the risks are (your intelligence requirements) helps you be more strategic about where to start.\nIn my talk at Recorded Future Predict23 in Singapore, I mentioned a few tips based on lessons learned over time.\nTip #1: Instead of sending out daily security news summaries to a mailing list, try referencing a security report in an action item sent directly to the team who can remediate a specific security risk. \nBeing that filter between all the sensationalized articles and what your organization actually needs to action helped us build rapport and trust between teams. If you meet your peers halfway, actually read the report and try to make a call on what needs to be done and by whom, youve reduced a lot of mental labor for everyone involved. An added bonus is that you subconsciously train folks to pay attention to when you send them something, otherwise I wager pretty strongly that those daily digests are going to end up in the junk pile a lot of the time.\nTip #2: Instead of turning on threat intelligence modules and data feeds in all of your security tools, try only ingesting high-fidelity observables that directly map to a threat youre concerned about. \nThat doesnt mean you need to intentionally miss out on a bunch of data during collections. Something Bianca and I have built out is kind of like a tier-based system. All of the observables from our commercial and open source come into the threat intelligence platform (TIP), and they actually all go to the SIEM as well, but that doesnt mean they all are treated the same way. The bulk, raw data is used for enrichment and historical referencing. Then, as part of our usual operational cadence, we will research and validate a subset of observables that meet our intelligence requirements. \nBased on our research, well add extra context and metadata to those observables and intentionally mark them as curated so that they become active in our security tools and can be used in detection or prevention rules. This way, we combat the perception that CTI is just a stream of low-fidelity observables that cause a lot of noise and alert fatigue. \nOnce we had that foundation of trust and confidence in the value and fidelity of the curated data, we could then weigh in on the detection engineering process by providing expertise on what metadata can be used  out of the remaining uncurated observable data  to satisfy specific detection use cases.\nAs you're putting together your Cyber Threat Intelligence function, what kind of information is needed?\n(Zito) Once you've got your intelligence requirements  pick three to start off with and then work back from there you could ask yourself:\n\nWhat information do I need to answer those questions? \nIs it open source information? Is it commercial intelligence? A mixture of both?\nWhat data do I need?  How will I then consume that data? \nDo I have a threat intelligence platform?\n\nYou need to figure out where you're going to put all of that information, and understand whether you have the technical capability to actually manage all of that infrastructure yourself. If you're a small team and you don't have a lot of engineering resources, maybe you'll actually start off with something commercial and buy instead of build so you dont have to think about managing infrastructure and can instead focus on actual analysis.\nIt can be tempting to get started using open source tooling. I love that theres passionate people out there collectively building free tools to help with CTI operations. I would be cautious here about the time and skills needed to maintain some of these systems, as they can require a bit of TLC and jerry-rigging. Again, starting small and being intentional about your desired outcome is your best shot at incremental success.\nWhen it comes to people, there are a lot of varying skills among CTI practitioners. For example, because of Bianca's pentesting background, shes very technically proficient and good at researching how adversary TTPs evolve; and there are other folks who specialize in what I would call more traditional intelligence analysis. It really just depends on your organization and what's going to work best to satisfy your intelligence requirements.  \nIf, like Canva, your organization is tech and software-centric, maybe its important you have people with the technical ability to understand how the latest obscure exploit could actually impact you, if at all. Whereas, if you are in critical infrastructure, maybe you need a bit more of that geopolitical background to help you understand which APT groups are a threat to your organization by understanding why somebody would try to come after critical infrastructure in the first place. \nHow do you think about connecting your people, tools and workflows?\n(Zito) If you think about the teams consuming your intelligence products as customers, you need to understand their ways of working, their pain points, and what they need from you to support them. I usually pick one customer at a time, and pilot a workflow end-to-end based after sitting down with them and understanding their requirements.\nIf youre into games, pretend this is a role-playing game (RPG) and youre the support class. Your job is throwing heals and buffs. Youre likely not on the front lines in the heat of the battle, so its not really fair if you insist on calling all the shots.\nIf you use your blue team / SOC as an example first customer, they very likely have their own tooling for detections, their own case management system to house investigations and incidents, and their own internal comms channels. Nobody wants to receive an email with an attached report that has a bunch of random observables listed at the end in no particular format, that they then have to manually put into a system. What a waste of time!\nWhen you talk to your blue team, you may learn that if they could have anything they wanted, it would be for someone to do all that for them and to not have to think about it. Theres no real reason they need to read a report for the threat to be blocked. If they need context, theyll be able to find it if an alert ever triggers. \nUnfortunately, we (CTI) really dont want to be copy-paste robots either. So we automate. In cases where the analysis has already been done and all we need to do is block some hashes or C2 IPs, why does anyone have to be involved in the process? CTI should be able to click a button to validate an observable, and based on metadata, it goes where it needs to go. Thats essentially what we ended up building. \nAnd that actually means now that when an intelligence report is published, its much more likely to be read, because the last one wasnt just a day ago. We want people to feel confident that silence from us equals no threat to worry about.\n(Forbes) A good example of an integrated workflow with Recorded Future is how we develop threat hunting packages. Our team is continually tracking trends in the threat landscape and we have processes to help us identify what is relevant to us. Reflecting back on the idea behind the tier-based system we have for observables, we consume all of the threat hunting packages Recorded Future publishes. Once we identify a threat trend we want to hunt for, we can use the relevant ingested packages as a building block for the final deliverable. Its especially helpful considering they come with YARA rules and TTPs, so it reduces some of the manual work we have to do. \nOnce a hunting package is developed, weve built an automated message that sends all the relevant information to the threat hunting team, again, integrating with their workflow and tooling. Another benefit of working closely with our customers when designing integrations is we can get valuable feedback about the outcomes of our intelligence products.\nAnother example workflow is how we mitigate risks associated with our supply chain vendors. By populating our suppliers watch list within Recorded Future, we can then look for things like who's attacking our suppliers. An example would be if one of our critical vendors has been posted on a ransomware blog site. Oftentimes we'll learn about that through Recorded Future before the vendor even reaches out and says, Hey, we've had an incident. Yeah, we know we've been watching. Recorded Future allows us to get on the front foot in those types of situations.\nHow do you showcase the value that youre bringing to the rest of the security organization? And to the rest of the company?\n(Zito) We track the fidelity of our deliverables by showing how much information and data we consume and how much of that turned into some kind of action. \nFor example, if we pulled in 100 threat reports; shortlisted 20 based on the topic meeting our intelligence requirements; and only 3 turned into an internal threat bulletin with recommended actions - thats actually a good thing. It shows that we filtered and curated information really well before it got on anyones to-do list.\nIt doesnt stop at recommendations or information shared, though. We also want to know how much of the work we have generated for other teams resulted in something useful. If we published a threat hunting package and no malicious activity was uncovered, thats great. But what else did we discover? Were there any new detection ideas as a result? Is there any additional telemetry that we could monitor? \nWhen we're talking about showing value to the broader organization, it's really about taking the macro trends from all of those metrics and surfacing it into high level insights. Imagine if you started out thinking malware was your biggest threat because thats what your industrys threat landscape is telling you. \nOnce you start collecting data about the outcomes of your intelligence products  What category of observables triggered the most alerts? How many threat bulletins resulted in a security investigation and subsequent uplift, and in what areas? \nYou may learn your biggest threat is something entirely different. Or, if you dont, at least the data validates your current assessment. Either way, this can help you drive your overall security strategy by supporting continued investment into existing focus areas or highlighting areas that may need more attention.",

It represents a significant cross-platform threat, utilizing a variety of malware to compromise users&#39; systems. The threat actors have prepared a resilient infrastructure, allowing them to quickly adapt by rebranding or shifting focus upon detection. The report highlights the necessity of continuous vigilance and recommends that individuals and organizations adopt comprehensive mitigation strategies against these sophisticated phishing tactics.</p><p>Specific findings reveal that the malware versions, including AMOS, can infect both Intel and Apple M1 Macs, indicating a broad vulnerability among users.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Insikt Group examines a large-scale Russian-language cybercrime operation using fake Web3 gaming initiatives to distribute malware designed to steal information from both macOS and Windows users. These Web3 games, which are based on blockchain technology, offer the potential for financial gains through cryptocurrency earnings. \nWeb of Deceit: The Rise of Imitation Web3 Gaming Scams and Malware Infections\nThe campaign involves creating imitation Web3 gaming projects with slight name and branding modifications to appear legitimate, along with fake social media accounts to bolster their authenticity. The main webpages of these projects offer downloads that, once installed, infect devices with various types of \"infostealer\" malware such as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), Stealc, Rhadamanthys, or RisePro, depending on the operating system.\nFraudulent Web3 gaming project status (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe campaign targets Web3 gamers, exploiting their potential lack of cyber hygiene in the pursuit of profits. It represents a significant cross-platform threat, utilizing a variety of malware to compromise users' systems. The threat actors have prepared a resilient infrastructure, allowing them to quickly adapt by rebranding or shifting focus upon detection. The report highlights the necessity of continuous vigilance and recommends that individuals and organizations adopt comprehensive mitigation strategies against these sophisticated phishing tactics.\nSpecific findings reveal that the malware versions, including AMOS, can infect both Intel and Apple M1 Macs, indicating a broad vulnerability among users. The primary goal appears to be the theft of cryptocurrency wallets, posing a significant risk to financial security. Despite potential mitigations like endpoint detection and antivirus software, the campaign's techniques remain effective, suggesting the need for broader defense measures. Artifacts within the HTML code hint at the Russian origin of the threat actors, though their exact location remains uncertain. The report underscores the critical need for awareness and education to prevent downloads from unverified sources, highlighting the risk of brand damage to legitimate Web3 gaming projects if such threats are not adequately addressed.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of

However, improving dark web monitoring capabilities can help organizations be proactive in mitigating threats to their business, their customers, and their supply chain.  </p><h3 id=\"how-does-the-dark-web-affect-organizations\">How does the dark web affect organizations?</h3><p>The dark web in itself is not all that dangerous to most organizations, but whats taking place there should pique the interest of defenders. The dark web provides a platform for ransomware groups to operate and for bad actors to sell and exchange malware, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/how-to-triage-leaked-credentials\">compromised credentials</a>, exploit kits, and stolen payment cards.</p><h4 id=\"ransomware\">Ransomware</h4><p>The dark web is a well known home for ransomware groups, which continued to wreak havoc on organizations in 2023. In the past year, ransomware payments ballooned to $1.1 billion (<a href=\"https://therecord.media/ransomware-payments-doubled-to-more-than-1-billion-2023\">The Record</a>) and, according to a report from <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/the-ransomware-threat-in-2024-is-growing-report/\">Delinea</a>, 76% of victims paid a ransom. The dark web provides a secure and anonymous environment for ransomware groups to communicate, collaborate, and conduct their illicit activities.  </p><h4 id=\"credentials\">Credentials</h4><p>Dark web markets and forums are popular destinations for initial access brokers and threat actors looking to sell and buy valid credentials. Valid credentials have become so popular for threat actors that under MITRE ATT&amp;CKs initial access vectors, Valid Accounts (T1078) was the top TTP according to both <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/2023-annual-report\">Recorded Future</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/L0GKXDWJ\">IBM X-Force</a>.</p><p>Using information from our <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence\">Identity Intelligence</a> module, Recorded Future researchers found a 135% rise in the overall number of harvested credentials and a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/2023-annual-report\">166%</a> increase in credentials associated with cookies. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence?utm_content=SRCWW&p1=Search&p4=43700079592066625&p5=e&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwq86wBhDiARIsAJhuphncRPuRrpSJ3EiavMqrf8Uva7poktd7mlJt3PjtbzN8ElcunRfT35AaAh0OEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds\">researchers at IBM found a 266%</a> upsurge in the use of infostealers. With the right access and contacts, someone could purchase a valid credential for just $10, enabling them to log in to a corporate network or personal account, bypass multi-factor authentication controls, and begin their infiltration. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Dark_Web_Blog_Post_Identity_7007048e3c.webp\" alt=\"DarkWebBlogPost_Identity.webp\"><em>Recorded Futures <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence\">Identity Intelligence</a> module helps organizations defend against employee and customer credentials that have been stolen by infostealer malware. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/videos/toyota\">Watch</a> how Toyota Motors North America defends against compromised credentials, and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/splunk/mitigate-account-takeovers\">take an interactive tour</a> of Identity Intelligence.</em></p><h4 id=\"exploit-kits\">Exploit Kits</h4><p>Similar to how novice cooks purchase meal kits, less-skilled threat actors can purchase exploit kits on the dark web. Despite their <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0209.pdf\">slight dip in popularity</a>, dark web exploit kits are pre-packaged tools and frameworks that cybercriminals use to exploit vulnerabilities in software and systems. These kits make it easier for threat actors to launch attacks and gain unauthorized access to targeted systems. They often provide a convenient gateway for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities without needing advanced technical skills. </p><h4 id=\"payment-cards\">Payment Cards</h4><p>In 2022 it looked like the dark web market for stolen credit cards was slowing down. However, supply bounced back to previous levels in 2023. According to the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2023\">2023 Annual Payment Fraud Intelligence Report</a> from Recorded Future, 71.4 million payment cards were posted for sale on the dark web in 2023, and another 48 million were posted for free on various sources. A median fraud charge of $79 caused $9.4 billion in preventable fraud losses for card issuers and $35 billion in potential chargeback fees for merchants and acquirers. </p><h3 id=\"how-does-recorded-future-remediate-threats-originating-on-the-dark-web\">How does Recorded Future remediate threats originating on the dark web?</h3><h4 id=\"ransomware-extortion-websites\">Ransomware Extortion Websites</h4><p>Threat actors use ransomware extortion websites to threaten to leak victim files. These files often include network details, financial information and documents, PII, employee or client credentials, and other sensitive information that motivates the victim to pay the ransom. Victims who concede typically do so based on a promise that the data will be deleted, but we saw with <a href=\"https://therecord.media/lockbit-lied-about-deleting-exfiltrated-data-after-ransom-payments\">Lockbit</a> that this doesnt always happen. On the other hand, victims who dont pay are likely to have additional data leaks posted to the extortion site. </p><p>For years, Recorded Future has collected information from ransomware extortion websites, analyzed it, and turned it into actionable intelligence to help organizations <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/ransomware\">proactively mitigate the impact of a ransomware attack</a>. Presently, Recorded Future collects information from text posts, images, and leaked file metadata on over 100 ransomware extortion websites. </p><p>Information found in ransomware victim metadata can help identify companies and organizations that could be direct or indirect victims of a ransomware attack. Access to leaked file metadata enables organizations to investigate leads for potential data exposure that could impact them as well as relevant third and fourth parties. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/FI_Blog_Image_1_7f0f6d9b4d.webp\" alt=\"FI Blog_Image 1.webp\"><em>Image of Recorded Futures ransomware victim metadata analysis, which helps identify organizations that are most likely to be victims (direct or indirect) of a ransomware incident.</em></p><h4 id=\"dark-web-markets\">Dark Web Markets</h4><p>Unlike e-commerce sites on the open web, dark web markets like Russian Market, 2Easy, and others make their fortunes selling compromised credentials, PII, and stolen credit cards. Threat actors can use this information to access an employees account, create personalized <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/typosquatting-domains-analysis\">spearphishing campaigns</a>, or place fraudulent transactions. </p><p>Recorded Future collects information from a number of dark web markets to help organizations mitigate any risk stemming from items for sale. For example, by <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/payment-fraud-intelligence\">identifying stolen credit card information</a> being sold on dark web markets, card issuers can place heightened controls on cards with a high risk of being used for fraud. Additional signals, such as the card being sold or used in transactions with known tester merchants, can enable the issuer to take proactive actions to block the card from further transactions or issue the customer a new card. </p><p>According to a large <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/case-studies/lg-finance-inst-payment-fraud.pdf\">North American financial institution</a>, When transactions occur on customer cards identified by Recorded Future as being present on the dark web or used on known tester merchants, most of the time the transaction is actually fraudulent. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Dark_Web_Blog_Image_2_e7c38d4b99.webp\" alt=\"Dark Web Blog - Image 2.webp\"><em>Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence detects compromised payment cards for sale on the dark web, enabling financial institutions to take a proactive approach to preventing fraud.</em></p><h4 id=\"dark-web-forums\">Dark Web Forums</h4><p>Dark web forums are often where conversations get started between threat actors, those with something to sell, and lower-skilled cybercriminals looking for more advanced tools. Threat actors can exchange information, techniques, and tools to improve their hacking skills and stay up to date on the latest trends in cybercrime. Some will use dark web forums to recruit affiliates to carry out cybercriminal activities, including distributing malware, launching phishing campaigns, and participating in ransomware attacks. </p><p>Similar to dark web markets, dark web forums also serve as marketplaces where threat actors can sell compromised credentials, personal data, financial details, and other valuable information. They can also facilitate the trade of hacking tools, exploit kits, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/rat-corporate-risk-assessment\">remote access trojans (RATs)</a>, and other malicious software that can be used to compromise systems and networks. </p><p>Recorded Future collects information from over 250 top-tier and medium-tier dark web forum sources to provide actionable information to organizations. Information can include whether threat actors are mentioning an organizations brand or supply chain partners, whether any new vulnerabilities are being referenced, and which threat actors are known to utilize specific forums. </p><p>Frequent mentions of a company or product on the dark web often correlate, indicating an imminent attack, an illicit sale of company assets or accounts, or potentially more complex fraud schemes. </p><p>Dark web monitoring provides visibility into this restricted environment to help clients stay a step ahead of cybercrime campaigns that could affect their organizations, their suppliers, or the software products they use. </p><h4 id=\"telegram\">Telegram</h4><p>Since its creation in 2012, Telegram  a multi-purpose chat application  has quickly gained popularity among the underground cybercriminal community. Telegrams security, large number of chat options, and convenience have led to its growing popularity. Few dark web markets rival Telegrams reliability. </p><p>According to some experts, the future of large-scale, highly role-specialized criminal activity will take place on Telegram and future alternatives. Currently, cybercriminals have used Telegram groups to conduct transactions of illicit goods, post announcements from related internet forums, and communicate with fellow criminals. </p><p>Recorded Future helps organizations understand cyber-related chatter on Telegram about their own brands, relevant third parties, and other organizations of note. Since threat actors often discuss their activities on Telegram  whether theyre reporting planned attacks, exchanging information, or sharing findings  visibility enables organizations to stay out in front of threats and build resilience against unexpected risks. </p><p>Recorded Future helped one client detect exposed credentials on a Telegram channel, both identifying the threat and enhancing the urgency to remediate the risk. Another client in the financial services industry was able to identify a fraudulent check on a Telegram channel through Recorded Futures optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities. The analyst reported the incident to their internal fraud management team to prevent the check from being cashed. </p><h4 id=\"how-recorded-future-helps-mitigate-dark-web-threats\">How Recorded Future helps mitigate dark web threats</h4><p>Threat actors have long used dark web sites and forums to remain anonymous and attempt to gain an advantage over their targets. This is unlikely to change anytime soon. To combat this challenge, organizations require proactive visibility into the deep recesses of the dark web to ensure that they can mitigate threats. To help security practitioners and leaders, Recorded Future provides extensive intelligence across a wide range of dark web channels, which can be delivered via alerts, playbooks, and human-curated intelligence reports. </p><h4 id=\"alert-notifications\">Alert Notifications</h4><p>Without timely alerting, intelligence becomes a collection of information. For many clients, the ability to prioritize alerts based on external <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence\">threat intelligence</a> and risk factors is crucial for improving their security operations and risk management.

      "content:encoded": "<h3 id=\"four-challenges-and-four-solutions-to-improve-resilience\">Four Challenges and Four Solutions to Improve Resilience</h3><p>Its no secret that cyber threat actors are hungry for customer data. According to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/L0GKXDWJ\">IBM</a>, data theft and leak was the most common impact for organizations that suffered an attack. In addition, a report from <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/the-ransomware-threat-in-2024-is-growing-report/\">Delinea</a> found that data exfiltration was the most prominent motivation for ransomware attacks today. </p><p>There are few industries that handle more valuable customer data than the financial services industry. Thus there are few targets more attractive to a threat actor. </p><p>Many financial services organizations have substantial amounts of money and assets, which can make them attractive to ransomware attackers keen on going after big game targets. And the interconnected nature of the financial sector means that compromising one institution or commonly used product can lead to broader impacts across the entire industry. </p><p>In Recorded Futures recent fireside chat webinar, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/client-financial-services-fireside-chat\">Navigating Risk: How Threat Intelligence Is Transforming Financial Services</a>, Citizens Bank Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager Lea Cure summed up the complex nature of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/financial-services-cybersecurity-attack-surface-threats\">financial services cybersecurity</a>:</p><p>As a financial institution, we have money, we have peoples information. Thinking about how we protect that information is very different from other organizations. The technologies we use and the technologies we use to move money are critical. If those go down, what will we do? What are our playbooks?</p><p>In this blog well cover the challenges financial services organizations face, and how  for each challenge  threat intelligence provides critical context to help defenders be faster, more efficient, and more effective at preventing nefarious actors from stealing their customer data and impacting business operations.  </p><h2 id=\"challenge-1-supply-chain-attacks\">Challenge #1: Supply Chain Attacks</h2><p>On numerous occasions, prospects and clients across industries have told us that supply chain attacks are a top concern. In our <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/client-financial-services-fireside-chat\">fireside chat</a>, both our client panelists said they felt the same way. </p><p>Their concern is certainly warranted, as theres often little that can be done to prevent a supply chain attack. A <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-12-13-gartner-survey-finds-45-percent-of-organizations-experienced-third-party-related-business-interruptions-during-the-past-two-years\">Gartner survey</a> found that 45% of organizations experienced third-party-related business interruptions over the past couple years. </p><p>Outside of the financial industry theres a lot less regulation, especially in the technology service providers area, said Christopher Martinkus, a Threat Intelligence Manager for a North American commercial bank. Thats where you see a lot of these breaches occurring. I know for us, weve seen way more attacks on our third-party service providers than weve seen targeting us specifically. </p><p>As an example, threat actors like the ransomware group CL0P focus on <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/patterns-targets-ransomware-exploitation-vulnerabilities-2017-2023\">exploiting vulnerabilities</a> in file transfer software from Accellion, SolarWinds, and MOVEit. By gaining unauthorized access to files being transferred, CL0P has been able to steal sensitive information, encrypt files for ransom, and use the compromised files for other malicious activities. </p><p>Its becoming even more challenging to reduce risk across the supply chain in the as-a-service era. <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/experts/zachary-smith\">Zachary Smith</a>, Senior Principal of Research at <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-12-13-gartner-survey-finds-45-percent-of-organizations-experienced-third-party-related-business-interruptions-during-the-past-two-years\">Gartner</a>, said, Cybersecurity teams struggle to build resilience against third-party-related disruptions and to influence third-party-related business decisions. </p><h2 id=\"solution-mitigate-supply-chain-risk\">Solution: Mitigate Supply Chain Risk</h2><p>Can threat intelligence help organizations be more proactive in identifying risks that stem from their partners and vendors? Recorded Future client Christopher Martinkus thinks its possible to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/supply-chain\">mitigate supply chain risk</a>. </p><p>We&#39;ve actually had it where an alert came through that a third party of ours was listed on a ransomware extortion site, he said, and we were notifying that vendor before they even knew that they were listed there. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/unnamed_8_68500994f9.png\" alt=\"unnamed-8.png\"><em>Recorded Futures ransomware victim metadata analysis identifies a number of companies and organizations that are most likely to be victims (direct or indirect) of a ransomware incident based on patterns found in the file metadata.</em></p><p>Another financial services company was able to identify malicious network activity during the procurement process for a new vendor. In this instance, the company was able to flag the vendor as high risk and make sure to take a deeper look before onboarding.</p><p>With supply chain attacks, minutes and hours really matter. Decisions need to be made and steps need to be taken to keep the business secure. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence\">Threat intelligence</a> can provide real-time threat monitoring and assessment to help you overcome current challenges and ensure that your organization has the context needed to stay ahead of supply chain threats. </p><h2 id=\"challenge-2-ransomware\">Challenge #2: Ransomware</h2><p>While law enforcements disruption of the infamous ransomware group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6brblcARG0&t=1352s\">LockBit</a> was a win in the short term, in all likelihood ransomware will continue to be a major concern for financial services organizations. Weve already seen other disrupted ransomware groups bounce back.  </p><p>I dont think ransomware is going to stop, said Lea Cure. I think that its going to continue and continue to be a problem. </p><p>Christopher Martinkus added, Theyre going to stand up other variants that are similar to LockBit, and its kind of like the hydra theory  you cut off one head, you end up with two. </p><p>2023 was a banner year for ransomware groups. Ransomware payments doubled to more than $1.1 billion (<a href=\"https://therecord.media/ransomware-payments-doubled-to-more-than-1-billion-2023\">The Record</a>), and high-profile attacks received extensive media attention. Of organizations that suffered an attack, 62% lost revenue, 48% experienced reputation damage, and 48% lost customers (Delineas <em><a href=\"https://delinea.com/hubfs/Delinea/whitepapers/delinea-whitepaper-state-of-ransomware-2024-report.pdf\">State of Ransomware 2024</a></em>).  </p><p>Despite a dip in the number of victims posted to ransomware extortion sites in the new year (<a href=\"https://therecord.media/ransomware-tracker-the-latest-figures\">The Record - Ransomware Tracker</a>), its likely that numbers will increase. Financial services organizations should use the respite to enhance their defenses. </p><h2 id=\"solution-proactive-ransomware-mitigation\">Solution: Proactive Ransomware Mitigation</h2><p>To <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/ransomware\">mitigate ransomware attacks</a>, your financial institution needs proactive insights. One way to shift left is to focus on attackers that have a high intent to target the industry. </p><p>What are the tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) associated with these groups? What are their motivations? Are there hunting packages available to preemptively detect malicious infrastructure in your environment?  </p><p>Weve seen numerous cases where financial services clients have bolstered their defenses with helpful insights from Recorded Future. </p><p>One client has used the T-codes from the Ransomware MITRE Map in Recorded Futures Ransomware Dashboard to stay informed of potential ransomware TTPs. As a result, the client has saved time and enhanced their threat profiling. </p><p>Other clients have set up alerts to monitor for threat actors targeting their industry peers, helping them to prioritize the most pertinent threats to their business. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/unnamed_9_c25a5f336a.png\" alt=\"unnamed-9.png\"><em>The Recorded Future Ransomware Dashboard displaying key information pertaining to financial institutions. Users can also access a Ransomware MITRE Map to identify attack patterns and tactics based on the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework.</em></p><h2 id=\"challenge-3-digital-risks\">Challenge #3: Digital Risks</h2><p>In 2023, the top three initial access vectors in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix, according to the IBM X-Force <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/L0GKXDWJ\">Threat Intelligence Index</a>, were Valid Accounts (T1078), Phishing (T1566), and Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190). They were the top vectors by a wide margin. </p><p>In fact, according to the report there was a 71% increase year over year in the volume of attacks using legitimate credentials, which can likely be attributed to the 266% upsurge in use of infostealers.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Four Challenges and Four Solutions to Improve Resilience\nIts no secret that cyber threat actors are hungry for customer data. According to IBM, data theft and leak was the most common impact for organizations that suffered an attack. In addition, a report from Delinea found that data exfiltration was the most prominent motivation for ransomware attacks today. \nThere are few industries that handle more valuable customer data than the financial services industry. Thus there are few targets more attractive to a threat actor. \nMany financial services organizations have substantial amounts of money and assets, which can make them attractive to ransomware attackers keen on going after big game targets. And the interconnected nature of the financial sector means that compromising one institution or commonly used product can lead to broader impacts across the entire industry. \nIn Recorded Futures recent fireside chat webinar, Navigating Risk: How Threat Intelligence Is Transforming Financial Services, Citizens Bank Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager Lea Cure summed up the complex nature of financial services cybersecurity:\nAs a financial institution, we have money, we have peoples information. Thinking about how we protect that information is very different from other organizations. The technologies we use and the technologies we use to move money are critical. If those go down, what will we do? What are our playbooks?\nIn this blog well cover the challenges financial services organizations face, and how  for each challenge  threat intelligence provides critical context to help defenders be faster, more efficient, and more effective at preventing nefarious actors from stealing their customer data and impacting business operations.  \nChallenge #1: Supply Chain Attacks\nOn numerous occasions, prospects and clients across industries have told us that supply chain attacks are a top concern. In our fireside chat, both our client panelists said they felt the same way. \nTheir concern is certainly warranted, as theres often little that can be done to prevent a supply chain attack. A Gartner survey found that 45% of organizations experienced third-party-related business interruptions over the past couple years. \nOutside of the financial industry theres a lot less regulation, especially in the technology service providers area, said Christopher Martinkus, a Threat Intelligence Manager for a North American commercial bank. Thats where you see a lot of these breaches occurring. I know for us, weve seen way more attacks on our third-party service providers than weve seen targeting us specifically. \nAs an example, threat actors like the ransomware group CL0P focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in file transfer software from Accellion, SolarWinds, and MOVEit. By gaining unauthorized access to files being transferred, CL0P has been able to steal sensitive information, encrypt files for ransom, and use the compromised files for other malicious activities. \nIts becoming even more challenging to reduce risk across the supply chain in the as-a-service era. Zachary Smith, Senior Principal of Research at Gartner, said, Cybersecurity teams struggle to build resilience against third-party-related disruptions and to influence third-party-related business decisions. \nSolution: Mitigate Supply Chain Risk\nCan threat intelligence help organizations be more proactive in identifying risks that stem from their partners and vendors? Recorded Future client Christopher Martinkus thinks its possible to mitigate supply chain risk. \nWe've actually had it where an alert came through that a third party of ours was listed on a ransomware extortion site, he said, and we were notifying that vendor before they even knew that they were listed there. \nRecorded Futures ransomware victim metadata analysis identifies a number of companies and organizations that are most likely to be victims (direct or indirect) of a ransomware incident based on patterns found in the file metadata.\nAnother financial services company was able to identify malicious network activity during the procurement process for a new vendor. In this instance, the company was able to flag the vendor as high risk and make sure to take a deeper look before onboarding.\nWith supply chain attacks, minutes and hours really matter. Decisions need to be made and steps need to be taken to keep the business secure. Threat intelligence can provide real-time threat monitoring and assessment to help you overcome current challenges and ensure that your organization has the context needed to stay ahead of supply chain threats. \nChallenge #2: Ransomware\nWhile law enforcements disruption of the infamous ransomware group LockBit was a win in the short term, in all likelihood ransomware will continue to be a major concern for financial services organizations. Weve already seen other disrupted ransomware groups bounce back.  \nI dont think ransomware is going to stop, said Lea Cure. I think that its going to continue and continue to be a problem. \nChristopher Martinkus added, Theyre going to stand up other variants that are similar to LockBit, and its kind of like the hydra theory  you cut off one head, you end up with two. \n2023 was a banner year for ransomware groups. Ransomware payments doubled to more than $1.1 billion (The Record), and high-profile attacks received extensive media attention. Of organizations that suffered an attack, 62% lost revenue, 48% experienced reputation damage, and 48% lost customers (Delineas State of Ransomware 2024).  \nDespite a dip in the number of victims posted to ransomware extortion sites in the new year (The Record - Ransomware Tracker), its likely that numbers will increase. Financial services organizations should use the respite to enhance their defenses. \nSolution: Proactive Ransomware Mitigation\nTo mitigate ransomware attacks, your financial institution needs proactive insights. One way to shift left is to focus on attackers that have a high intent to target the industry. \nWhat are the tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) associated with these groups? What are their motivations? Are there hunting packages available to preemptively detect malicious infrastructure in your environment?  \nWeve seen numerous cases where financial services clients have bolstered their defenses with helpful insights from Recorded Future. \nOne client has used the T-codes from the Ransomware MITRE Map in Recorded Futures Ransomware Dashboard to stay informed of potential ransomware TTPs. As a result, the client has saved time and enhanced their threat profiling. \nOther clients have set up alerts to monitor for threat actors targeting their industry peers, helping them to prioritize the most pertinent threats to their business. \nThe Recorded Future Ransomware Dashboard displaying key information pertaining to financial institutions. Users can also access a Ransomware MITRE Map to identify attack patterns and tactics based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.\nChallenge #3: Digital Risks\nIn 2023, the top three initial access vectors in the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, according to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, were Valid Accounts (T1078), Phishing (T1566), and Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190). They were the top vectors by a wide margin. \nIn fact, according to the report there was a 71% increase year over year in the volume of attacks using legitimate credentials, which can likely be attributed to the 266% upsurge in use of infostealers. According to Recorded Futures 2023 Adversary Infrastructure Report, RedLine Stealer and Raccoon Stealer were the most popular infostealers, based on the number of unique C2 servers observed. \nWhy are infostealer malware and compromised credentials so valuable to threat actors? Recorded Future Product Manager Director Dmitry Smilyanets writes in his blog post Session Hijacking and MFA Bypass, Cybercriminals can use stolen sessions to authenticate to web applications and services, allowing them to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) checkpoints. \nDespite no longer being the top initial access vector, phishing is still prevalent. According to a brand protection report from Mimecast, brand impersonations have risen by more than 360% since 2020. This is likely due to cybercriminals using domains, corporate names, slogans, logos, and executive impersonation to create communications that look like theyre coming from legitimate financial services organizations. \nAs organizations continue to grow their digital channels and embrace the advantages of cloud-based resources, their external attack surfaces are in a constant state of change and growth. An explosion of new internet-facing assets, numerous cloud environments, and more entry points for a remote workforce all lead to visibility challenges that can increase the risk of exploitation. According to an Enterprise Strategy Group report, 76% of organizations have suffered a cyberattack that started with the exploit of an unknown, unmanaged, or poorly managed internet-facing asset. \nSolution: Digital Risk Protection and Exposure Management\nPreventing digital risks requires improving visibility into digital blind spots. Whether youre concerned with compromised credentials, typosquat domains, or vulnerable assets, visibility is essential to monitoring, prioritizing, and remediating risks to your enterprise. \nConsidering the popularity of valid credentials and infostealer malware among cybercriminals, its critical to find and remediate compromised credentials before they can be used. When one employees personal computer was infected with infostealer malware, Toyota Motors North America used Recorded Future to gain advanced warning about the compromised credentials and proactively secure the employees account before threat actors made a large number of attempts to use the stolen credentials. \nThe homepage for Recorded Futures Identity Intelligence module helps financial institutions identify where credentials are being stolen, what technologies are exposed, and the infostealer malware used.\nMonitoring for typosquat domains and fake login pages can help reduce the chances your employees, customers, or partners fall for a phishing campaign.

We're actually moving forward with the Payment Fraud module in Recorded Future.

Mathusha is a fairly new futurist, she joined the company 8 months ago with previous experience as an analyst with a CTI team.</p><p> <em>While completing my Masters, I ended up doing a placement in the Information Security department. Thats where I first got introduced to cybersecurity and thats where it all started. - Mathusha</em></p><p>Mathusha has had quite an unconventional path to cybersecurity as well. With a background in Cognitive Science and Linguistics she imagined herself exploring Occupational Therapy or Health Informatics. I quickly realized that it was not the right path for me. So, she decided to pursue a Masters in Information Management and Information System Design and got certified in cybersecurity, data protection, and digital forensics. I landed my first job as an analyst/consultant. It was in a telecommunications companys CTI team, who just happened to be a client of Recorded Future.  </p><h2 id=\"sharing-your-story\">Sharing Your Story</h2><p><em>A company is more than just its product or outputs - Chelsea</em></p><p>Chelsea shared with us why she thinks highlighting employee stories is so important. Not only is it a window into what its like working within an organization, its also a great way to understand and appreciate the different challenges or obstacles one can experience and how it can impact both team and organizational dynamics. Even more so when youre focusing on marginalized or minority representation. When there are more diverse voices at the table, the companys product is in a better position to succeed. </p><p> <em>It was evident that there werent a lot of people that looked like me in the field. - Mathusha</em></p><p>Mathusha adds that in addition to her untraditional path, being a woman of color in the industry further augmented the obstacles she encountered. I really wanted people to know that if you put your mind to it, you can make it happen and make a positive impact. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/unnamed_6_c152ebaa8f.png\" alt=\"unnamed-6.png\"><em>Mathusha with her grandfather in 2020</em></p><h2 id=\"working-at-recorded-future\">Working at Recorded Future</h2><p> <em>I can relate to the clients because I used to be one of them. - Mathusha</em></p><p>Mathusha describes her day-to-day filled with client meetings where she assesses needs and answers any technical questions. She also prepares technical engagements such as enablement workshops or strategic briefs. One thing I have found interesting is how people consult. Sitting in on customer meetings with other consultants, theres a lot of room for creativity, its not as cookie cutter as one may think. She also notes how Recorded Future is intentional about fostering interdepartmental connections. I never experienced that before. Working here, I have been able to collaborate across departments and locations and made some great friendships along the way.</p><p>Chelsea shared about how her first job at Recorded Future, as an editor, puts her in a unique position as an analyst. I review a lot of our reports that arent directly related to my job, and I am our go-to analyst for collaborative reports with other teams within Recorded Future. As a fraud intel analyst, my day-to-day consists of reviewing data and investing leads to report on payment card breaches via links to records being sold on the dark web.</p><h2 id=\"erg-community-learning-and-growth\">ERG Community, Learning and Growth</h2><p>Mathusha and Chelsea shared the reasons why they decided to get involved in ERG leadership with our womens group. </p><p>Chelsea went to a womens college in Pennsylvania for her undergraduate degree, and then attended a formerly womens college in Virginia for her graduate degree. At both institutions I held leadership positions within extracurricular activities, and I had a great experience in my academic career being surrounded by like-minded women. I wanted to foster that kind of space within Recorded Future. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/unnamed_7_f298655b9c.png\" alt=\"unnamed-7.png\"><em>Chelsea on her yearly vacation to a ranch in upstate New York</em></p><p>In addition to wanting to connect with women in the industry, Mathusha explained that through the ERG she wants to help other futurists (and herself) address hard questions. Im starting to look at aspects of my life that I hadnt been looking at before, such as having kids and how that could impact my career. She hopes to help in fostering healthy conversations, providing resources, and promoting an inclusive and safe environment.</p><p>A safe space, community, mentorship, support, learning, growth..Its hard to choose just one way one can benefit from taking part in an employee resource group such as our Womens group. But, at its core, are the extraordinarily passionate and committed people you get to connect and collaborate with. </p><p>Mathusha described that the most rewarding thing so far has been being able to connect with other individuals that I wouldnt have otherwise. Chelsea shared a similar sentiment: When I joined Women@RF as a co-chair last year, our entire cohort was new to being ERG leaders and I had been at the company for less than a year. As an ERG, we were determined to develop the groups global reach. In that aspect, Ive connected with a lot of new people in the company that I likely otherwise wouldnt have, and this year I will be using those connections to further increase collaboration amongst our different employee groups.</p><h2 id=\"join-our-journey\">Join Our Journey</h2><p> <em>I feel like I have found a community that Im proud to be part of. - Mathusha</em></p><p>We are truly inspired by the dedication and commitment to progress and community of Chelsea, Mathusha, and many others. We hope you also feel empowered by the stories shared today and we leave you with one last piece of advice from Chelsea: Do it! Get to know your coworkers lives outside of work.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "This years themes for Womens History Month and International Womens Day overlap in a really meaningful way. Women Who Advocate for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and Inspire Inclusion focus on the celebration of those who have committed to creating a more equitable society for all and in all aspects of life. It focuses on those who inspire empowerment, progress, and community.\nThere's a powerful connection created when we celebrate the stories of pioneering women who were leaders that spoke out  for equality, as they now inspire current advocates for equity, diversity, and inclusion to build on their significant achievements. \nChelsea and Mathusha, two of Recorded Futures Women ERG 2024 leaders, showcase their commitment to building a more inclusive work environment for all and inspire significant strides. In reading this blog, we hope you get as inspired as we were interviewing Chelsea and Mathusha.\nFrom left, Chelsea Wilson, Fraud Intelligence Analyst, and Mathusha Sanjeevan, Intelligence Services Consultant.\nThe Journey Up Until Now\nId been applying for jobs at Recorded Future since well before I graduated. - Chelsea\nChelsea joined Recorded Future about two years ago, a few months after graduating with her MA in Forensic and Legal Psychology from Marymount University. Mathusha is a fairly new futurist, she joined the company 8 months ago with previous experience as an analyst with a CTI team.\n While completing my Masters, I ended up doing a placement in the Information Security department. Thats where I first got introduced to cybersecurity and thats where it all started. - Mathusha\nMathusha has had quite an unconventional path to cybersecurity as well. With a background in Cognitive Science and Linguistics she imagined herself exploring Occupational Therapy or Health Informatics. I quickly realized that it was not the right path for me. So, she decided to pursue a Masters in Information Management and Information System Design and got certified in cybersecurity, data protection, and digital forensics. I landed my first job as an analyst/consultant. It was in a telecommunications companys CTI team, who just happened to be a client of Recorded Future.  \nSharing Your Story\nA company is more than just its product or outputs - Chelsea\nChelsea shared with us why she thinks highlighting employee stories is so important. Not only is it a window into what its like working within an organization, its also a great way to understand and appreciate the different challenges or obstacles one can experience and how it can impact both team and organizational dynamics. Even more so when youre focusing on marginalized or minority representation. When there are more diverse voices at the table, the companys product is in a better position to succeed. \n It was evident that there werent a lot of people that looked like me in the field. - Mathusha\nMathusha adds that in addition to her untraditional path, being a woman of color in the industry further augmented the obstacles she encountered. I really wanted people to know that if you put your mind to it, you can make it happen and make a positive impact. \nMathusha with her grandfather in 2020\nWorking at Recorded Future\n I can relate to the clients because I used to be one of them. - Mathusha\nMathusha describes her day-to-day filled with client meetings where she assesses needs and answers any technical questions. She also prepares technical engagements such as enablement workshops or strategic briefs. One thing I have found interesting is how people consult. Sitting in on customer meetings with other consultants, theres a lot of room for creativity, its not as cookie cutter as one may think. She also notes how Recorded Future is intentional about fostering interdepartmental connections. I never experienced that before. Working here, I have been able to collaborate across departments and locations and made some great friendships along the way.\nChelsea shared about how her first job at Recorded Future, as an editor, puts her in a unique position as an analyst. I review a lot of our reports that arent directly related to my job, and I am our go-to analyst for collaborative reports with other teams within Recorded Future. As a fraud intel analyst, my day-to-day consists of reviewing data and investing leads to report on payment card breaches via links to records being sold on the dark web.\nERG Community, Learning and Growth\nMathusha and Chelsea shared the reasons why they decided to get involved in ERG leadership with our womens group. \nChelsea went to a womens college in Pennsylvania for her undergraduate degree, and then attended a formerly womens college in Virginia for her graduate degree. At both institutions I held leadership positions within extracurricular activities, and I had a great experience in my academic career being surrounded by like-minded women. I wanted to foster that kind of space within Recorded Future. \nChelsea on her yearly vacation to a ranch in upstate New York\nIn addition to wanting to connect with women in the industry, Mathusha explained that through the ERG she wants to help other futurists (and herself) address hard questions. Im starting to look at aspects of my life that I hadnt been looking at before, such as having kids and how that could impact my career. She hopes to help in fostering healthy conversations, providing resources, and promoting an inclusive and safe environment.\nA safe space, community, mentorship, support, learning, growth..Its hard to choose just one way one can benefit from taking part in an employee resource group such as our Womens group. But, at its core, are the extraordinarily passionate and committed people you get to connect and collaborate with. \nMathusha described that the most rewarding thing so far has been being able to connect with other individuals that I wouldnt have otherwise. Chelsea shared a similar sentiment: When I joined Women@RF as a co-chair last year, our entire cohort was new to being ERG leaders and I had been at the company for less than a year. As an ERG, we were determined to develop the groups global reach. In that aspect, Ive connected with a lot of new people in the company that I likely otherwise wouldnt have, and this year I will be using those connections to further increase collaboration amongst our different employee groups.\nJoin Our Journey\n I feel like I have found a community that Im proud to be part of. - Mathusha\nWe are truly inspired by the dedication and commitment to progress and community of Chelsea, Mathusha, and many others. We hope you also feel empowered by the stories shared today and we leave you with one last piece of advice from Chelsea: Do it! Get to know your coworkers lives outside of work. We can be professional and personable. Everyone has a different perspective on life and work - joining ERG spaces can help you understand those differences!\nCheck out our most recent stories: Black History Month '24, Veterans Day '23, Hispanic Heritage Month 23, Pride Month 23, APIDA Month 23.",

This infrastructure is believed to be in use in at least eleven countries, including Angola, Armenia, Botswana, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Oman, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago. Notably, this is the first identification of Predator customers in Botswana and the Philippines. Despite being marketed for counterterrorism and law enforcement, Predator is often used against civil society, targeting journalists, politicians, and activists, with no specific victims or targets currently identified in this latest activity.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Predator_Spyware_1853b51071.png\" alt=\"Predator-Spyware.png\"><em>Multi-tier Predator delivery network architecture (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id=\"understanding-risks-and-implementing-security-best-practices\">Understanding Risks and Implementing Security Best Practices</h2><p>The use of spyware like Predator poses significant risks to privacy, legality, and physical safety, especially when used outside serious crime and counterterrorism contexts. High-profile individuals, such as executives, are at greater risk due to the high costs of deploying such spyware. The European Union has recently taken steps to curb the abuse of mercenary spyware among its member states.</p><p>To mitigate these risks, organizations and individuals are advised to follow security best practices such as regular phone updates, device reboots, lockdown mode, Mobile Device Management systems, and separating personal from corporate devices. Security awareness training and minimal data exposure culture are also crucial. Long-term solutions include conducting risk assessments for developing dynamic security policies. As the mercenary spyware market expands, the risks extend beyond civil society to anyone of interest to entities with access to these tools. Innovations in this field are likely to lead to more stealthy and comprehensive spyware capabilities.</p><p>Key findings from the Insikt Group&#39;s research include the identification of a new multi-tiered Predator delivery infrastructure, with evidence from domain analysis and network intelligence data. Despite public disclosures in September 2023, Predator&#39;s operators have continued their operations with minimal changes. Predator, alongside NSO Groups Pegasus, remains a leading provider of mercenary spyware, with consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures over time.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a

      "content:encodedSnippet": "New research from Recorded Futures Insikt Group examines newly discovered infrastructure related to the operators of Predator, a mercenary mobile spyware. This infrastructure is believed to be in use in at least eleven countries, including Angola, Armenia, Botswana, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Oman, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago. Notably, this is the first identification of Predator customers in Botswana and the Philippines. Despite being marketed for counterterrorism and law enforcement, Predator is often used against civil society, targeting journalists, politicians, and activists, with no specific victims or targets currently identified in this latest activity.\nMulti-tier Predator delivery network architecture (Source: Recorded Future)\nUnderstanding Risks and Implementing Security Best Practices\nThe use of spyware like Predator poses significant risks to privacy, legality, and physical safety, especially when used outside serious crime and counterterrorism contexts. High-profile individuals, such as executives, are at greater risk due to the high costs of deploying such spyware. The European Union has recently taken steps to curb the abuse of mercenary spyware among its member states.\nTo mitigate these risks, organizations and individuals are advised to follow security best practices such as regular phone updates, device reboots, lockdown mode, Mobile Device Management systems, and separating personal from corporate devices. Security awareness training and minimal data exposure culture are also crucial. Long-term solutions include conducting risk assessments for developing dynamic security policies. As the mercenary spyware market expands, the risks extend beyond civil society to anyone of interest to entities with access to these tools. Innovations in this field are likely to lead to more stealthy and comprehensive spyware capabilities.\nKey findings from the Insikt Group's research include the identification of a new multi-tiered Predator delivery infrastructure, with evidence from domain analysis and network intelligence data. Despite public disclosures in September 2023, Predator's operators have continued their operations with minimal changes. Predator, alongside NSO Groups Pegasus, remains a leading provider of mercenary spyware, with consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures over time.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to

      "content:encoded": "<h2 id=\"understanding-ransom-policy-to-combat-ransomware\">Understanding Ransom Policy to Combat Ransomware</h2><p>While ransomware as an online threat may be relatively new, the criminal incentives behind the use of force and ransoms are not. Kidnapping for ransom as a crime has been traced as far back as <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=0b2aa002-abbc-4d71-a727-fa72aff90e4d\">ancient Rome</a>, giving researchers and policymakers precedent when investing resources into long-term anti-ransomware efforts, such as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2023/08/how-a-federal-ban-on-ransomware-payments-could-help-cisos#:~:text=A%20Ransom%20Ban%20Means%20Broader,outright%20ban%20on%20ransom%20payments.\">ongoing</a> <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ransom-payment-ban-outlook/705316/\">considerations</a> to ban ransomware payments to gangs, purchasing insurance, and mandating victim organizations to report ransomware attacks and payments. Below, we examine two case studies to shed light on lessons learned from two countries with a recent history of widespread kidnapping for ransom: Italy and Colombia.</p><p>Human kidnapping and ransomware are different versions of the same criminal concept: financial gain through the use of force and urgency  in other <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/logic-of-kidnapping-in-civil-war-evidence-from-colombia/906B5C3924A9EFE7E63A8646BFCF752E?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark\">words</a>, kidnapping explicitly links funding and force. There are natural differences between holding humans hostage for ransom and holding information for ransom: A companys assets will never have the same value as a human life. While this is an important distinction to make, it also means that experimenting with different solutions to counter ransomware is less risky than a <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/operation-jaque-rescue-mission-freed-hostages-held-in-colombian-jungle-180980222\">live rescue operation</a>.  </p><p>However, kidnapping can also be more complex for criminals than using ransomware. Maintaining a kidnapping operation takes a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/logic-of-kidnapping-in-civil-war-evidence-from-colombia/906B5C3924A9EFE7E63A8646BFCF752E?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark\">significant amount of resources and time</a>: Perpetrators need to allot time to plan and execute a kidnapping, then ensure that the hostages are kept alive for the possibility of an exchange and payment (which requires food, shelter, and other resources). All the while, the kidnappers must ensure that they do not leave any trails for law enforcement to follow. If kidnapping is not the central criminal activity for a criminal group (it rarely is), they also need to maintain their other criminal or terrorist activities throughout the kidnapping and negotiation process. These factors all weigh on the cost-benefit analysis of conducting kidnappings. Ransomware, in contrast, is often the central activity for gangs and has a lower barrier to entry than kidnapping, even if operations are still <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/conti-group-6m-salaries-tools\">expensive to maintain</a>. <a href=\"https://therecord.media/ransomware-payments-doubled-to-more-than-1-billion-2023\">The rise of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)</a> lowers this barrier even further and ensures a steady stream of profit for gangs.</p><p>Given the prevalence of the two crimes, different policy measures have been proposed to counter both kidnapping and ransomware to de-incentivize criminals. We evaluate the viability and success of such measures against precedent in an effort to understand which policy measures could assist in combating ransomware.</p><h2 id=\"option-1-ban-ransom-payments\">Option 1: Ban Ransom Payments</h2><p>In theory, a lack of payments would effectively reduce ransomware groups incentives and, over time, cause attacks to plummet. A majority of ransomware threat actors are financially motivated, meaning that they attack victims with the sole interest of collecting a ransom payment from them. In recent years, such reasoning has led policymakers to <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/australia-considers-ban-ransomware\">propose</a> bans on ransom payments to attackers.</p><p>To measure the potential of payment bans in practice, we will consider the effect that similar bans have had in the past in the context of human kidnapping. In 1991, Italy <a href=\"https://www.genevaassociation.org/sites/default/files/research-topics-document-type/pdf_public/ramsomware_summary_web.pdf\">banned</a> families from making payments to Italian organized crime groups (such as the mafia or the Ndrangheta) in an effort to curb endemic kidnapping. The law went so far as to freeze families assets to prevent them from paying kidnappers. In practice, the law appeared to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/world/italian-ban-on-paying-kidnappers-stirs-anger.html\">work</a>, with legal officials claiming that ransom kidnapping cases fell. A <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-italy/article/kidnappings-by-the-ndrangheta-characteristics-institutional-countermeasures-and-turning-points/BF89F822A566DC09C464E4FB1146B173\">paper</a> written by Cristina Barbieri, Assistant Professor in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the University of Pavia, and Vittorio Mete, Associate Professor in Political Sociology in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the University of Florence, also suggests that such bans directly affected crime groups decisions to conduct fewer and fewer kidnappings. (That said, these decisions were also influenced by the more convenient option of turning to the drug trade instead.) On the other hand, ransom payments continued to be sent through illicit channels to free loved ones, and the government had no way of knowing how many ransoms were being paid. Affected families <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/world/italian-ban-on-paying-kidnappers-stirs-anger.html\">disparaged</a> the ban, as claimed by a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/world/italian-ban-on-paying-kidnappers-stirs-anger.html\">New York Times article</a>, stating that the little they could do to bring their loved ones back was reduced to even less.  </p><p>While it is often noted, as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/world/italian-ban-on-paying-kidnappers-stirs-anger.html\">New York Times</a> does, that there were 691 reported kidnappings in Italy between 1969 and 1998, the data provided in Barbieri and Metes <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-italy/article/kidnappings-by-the-ndrangheta-characteristics-institutional-countermeasures-and-turning-points/BF89F822A566DC09C464E4FB1146B173#figures\">paper</a> shows that reported kidnappings were already well in decline when the ban was implemented. The number of reported kidnappings appears to have peaked at 73 in 1977 and was at fewer than 10 in 1990, the year before the ban went into effect (the number jumped to 12 in 1991). Unfortunately, the data published in Barbieri and Metes article does not appear to be available anywhere else for corroboration. But, based on their data, the year after the law went into effect, the number of kidnappings dipped to 1990 levels before increasing again in 1993 and finally tapering off after 1994.</p><p>The point is not to discount the number of kidnapping victims  one kidnapping victim is too many  but the law was implemented at a time when kidnappings in Italy were already in steep decline. Is it possible that the law helped accelerate that decline? Maybe, but it is hard to determine based on the numbers available.</p><p>Colombia <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/world/colombia-court-says-ransom-can-be-paid.html\">first</a> banned payment of kidnapping ransoms in 1993, at the start of the peak of kidnappings by the FARC-EP, a Marxist guerilla group. The measure was struck down soon after by a high court, which argued that any ban impinged on victim families right to privacy. But this was not just a problem for Colombian families; the problem extended to multinational corporations with expat employees in Colombia. In 2011, the Colombian government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12708011\">threatened</a> to restrict any multinational company from conducting business that was found to pay ransom demands for kidnapped employees. This followed the kidnapping of 23 employees of the Canadian energy company Talisman Energy after reports that the company had struck a deal with the rebels of around $2.6 million to release the employees.</p><p>Naturally, governments trying to avoid more kidnappings want to avoid <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12708011\">feeding</a> the incentive for groups to continue kidnapping people. Over time, a forceful ban on payment may decrease the amount of paid ransoms in some cases, but it has also meant that some of those who still pay ransoms simply refrain from reporting it. Instead, victims turn to <a href=\"https://paxforpeace.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/the-kidnap-industry-in-colombia-our-business-112001_0.pdf\">private negotiators</a> or security firms to get their loved ones back, seeing as they have less support from governments to recover their loved ones. Not only can this increase the problems severity for governments, but it can also reduce the visibility that they have into the problem. </p><p>In practice, some payments are already banned at the federal level when they <a href=\"https://www.insideprivacy.com/data-security/ofac-issues-updated-guidance-on-ransomware-payments/#:~:text=The%20Updated%20Advisory%20is%20largely,such%20payments%20when%20they%20constitute\">concern </a> the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. However, these sanctions are more concerned with financial controls at the national level than with cybersecurity-based policy surrounding ransomware payments; as such, they are outside the scope of this evaluation.</p><h2 id=\"option-2-ransom-insurance\">Option 2: Ransom Insurance</h2><p>Another proposed tool against both ransomware and kidnapping ransoms is purchasing insurance plans through private means. Clients purchase kidnapping insurance to claim in the case that they are kidnapped, and policies <a href=\"https://silentprofessionals.org/kidnap-ransom-insurance/#:~:text=Most%20policies%20cover%20ransom%20payments,management%2C%20and%20business%20interruption%20costs.\">typically</a> cover ransom payments, medical insurance, and loss of income related to the kidnapping. In the case of ransomware, ransomware insurance <a href=\"https://www.gbainsurance.com/ransomware_insurance_assessment\">typically</a> covers ransom payments, attack restoration costs, as well as lost income.</p><p>Kidnapping insurance is a protection that is consistently popular with individuals and organizations traveling to regions where &quot;<a href=\"https://www.controlrisks.com/riskmap?source=RMLP?utm_referrer=https://theconversation.com\">governments are weak and territory is disputed</a>&quot;. These individuals and organizations are particularly keen on getting insurance, especially considering that kidnapping is, unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/luis-diaz-father-kidnap-liverpool-found-n0h3msckm\">on the rise</a> once again in Colombia.</p><p>Similarly, the inability of law enforcement to stem the tide of ransomware attacks, in part due to the recalcitrance of the Russian government in arresting ransomware groups, has <a href=\"https://www.acumenresearchandconsulting.com/press-releases/cyber-insurance-market\">driven</a> the adoption of cyber insurance.</p><p>Experts from Kings College London and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) <a href=\"https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/whitehall-reports/insurance-crime-governance-comparing-kidnap-ransom-and-ransomware\">found</a> that over time, the kidnapping insurance industry has shaped norms that decrease filed claims by protecting targets as well as de-incentivizing the use of physical violence. This approach has also been <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rmir.12134\">aided</a> by crisis negotiation firms to handle ransom negotiations. On the other hand, these same experts found fewer positive effects from the ransomware insurance market, mostly given that this insurance market is still maturing. However, there is enough concern about cyber insurance interfering with reporting that a new proposed cybersecurity law in Massachusetts specially mentions cybersecurity companies, <a href=\"https://www.senatormikemoore.com/new-blog/2023/12/22/landmark-cybersecurity-and-ai-bill-approved-by-legislative-committee\">stating</a>: This provision requires that cybersecurity insurers cannot place limits on the ability of the insured to notify the government of a cybersecurity incident or data breach.</p><p>Some perceive that ransomware insurance will only worsen the problem of ransomware, as threat actors may target insured victims knowing that they have the funds to pay a ransom. Some ransomware groups have even <a href=\"https://grahamcluley.com/ransomware-gang-says-it-targets-firms-with-cyber-insurance\">claimed that they specifically look for victims</a> who have cyber insurance (though one should always be skeptical of any claims from ransomware groups).

These sources include state-based filings (like <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-updates-new-yorks-nation-leading-cybersecurity-regulations-part\">New York</a>), regulatory filings (like the new rule from the US Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&CIK=&type=8-K&owner=include&count=40&action=getcurrent\">mandating cyberattack reports</a>), and ransomware groups dark web extortion sites, among others.

Using several streams of reporting, the JEP was able to identify a total of 21,000 kidnapping victims between 1993 and 2012 in an effort to reunite families.

We have examined some of the major policy proposals to curb the activity of ransomware and identified that these are predominantly focused on curbing one factor: ransom payments themselves.

If their cost-benefit analysis were to fail, they would be less likely to continue maintaining the complex setup needed to extort payments from victims. </p><p>Part of this cost-benefit analysis is attention from law enforcement, a factor that is also true for human kidnappers.

A leading mafia boss, Tommaso Buscetta, stated that this prohibition stemmed from wanting to avoid attracting the attention of law enforcement to Sicily as a result of kidnapping, even if it meant that it would give the mafia less territorial control (in nearby regions, other groups had used kidnapping to strengthen its criminal networks and increasingly challenge state authority). </p><p>In April 2023, US Deputy Attorney General Monaco <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/doj-cybercrime-disruption-ransomware\">described</a> a pivot in US law enforcements strategy against cybercrime.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Understanding Ransom Policy to Combat Ransomware\nWhile ransomware as an online threat may be relatively new, the criminal incentives behind the use of force and ransoms are not. Kidnapping for ransom as a crime has been traced as far back as ancient Rome, giving researchers and policymakers precedent when investing resources into long-term anti-ransomware efforts, such as ongoing considerations to ban ransomware payments to gangs, purchasing insurance, and mandating victim organizations to report ransomware attacks and payments. Below, we examine two case studies to shed light on lessons learned from two countries with a recent history of widespread kidnapping for ransom: Italy and Colombia.\nHuman kidnapping and ransomware are different versions of the same criminal concept: financial gain through the use of force and urgency  in other words, kidnapping explicitly links funding and force. There are natural differences between holding humans hostage for ransom and holding information for ransom: A companys assets will never have the same value as a human life. While this is an important distinction to make, it also means that experimenting with different solutions to counter ransomware is less risky than a live rescue operation.  \nHowever, kidnapping can also be more complex for criminals than using ransomware. Maintaining a kidnapping operation takes a significant amount of resources and time: Perpetrators need to allot time to plan and execute a kidnapping, then ensure that the hostages are kept alive for the possibility of an exchange and payment (which requires food, shelter, and other resources). All the while, the kidnappers must ensure that they do not leave any trails for law enforcement to follow. If kidnapping is not the central criminal activity for a criminal group (it rarely is), they also need to maintain their other criminal or terrorist activities throughout the kidnapping and negotiation process. These factors all weigh on the cost-benefit analysis of conducting kidnappings. Ransomware, in contrast, is often the central activity for gangs and has a lower barrier to entry than kidnapping, even if operations are still expensive to maintain. The rise of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) lowers this barrier even further and ensures a steady stream of profit for gangs.\nGiven the prevalence of the two crimes, different policy measures have been proposed to counter both kidnapping and ransomware to de-incentivize criminals. We evaluate the viability and success of such measures against precedent in an effort to understand which policy measures could assist in combating ransomware.\nOption 1: Ban Ransom Payments\nIn theory, a lack of payments would effectively reduce ransomware groups incentives and, over time, cause attacks to plummet. A majority of ransomware threat actors are financially motivated, meaning that they attack victims with the sole interest of collecting a ransom payment from them. In recent years, such reasoning has led policymakers to propose bans on ransom payments to attackers.\nTo measure the potential of payment bans in practice, we will consider the effect that similar bans have had in the past in the context of human kidnapping. In 1991, Italy banned families from making payments to Italian organized crime groups (such as the mafia or the Ndrangheta) in an effort to curb endemic kidnapping. The law went so far as to freeze families assets to prevent them from paying kidnappers. In practice, the law appeared to work, with legal officials claiming that ransom kidnapping cases fell. A paper written by Cristina Barbieri, Assistant Professor in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the University of Pavia, and Vittorio Mete, Associate Professor in Political Sociology in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the University of Florence, also suggests that such bans directly affected crime groups decisions to conduct fewer and fewer kidnappings. (That said, these decisions were also influenced by the more convenient option of turning to the drug trade instead.) On the other hand, ransom payments continued to be sent through illicit channels to free loved ones, and the government had no way of knowing how many ransoms were being paid. Affected families disparaged the ban, as claimed by a New York Times article, stating that the little they could do to bring their loved ones back was reduced to even less.  \nWhile it is often noted, as the New York Times does, that there were 691 reported kidnappings in Italy between 1969 and 1998, the data provided in Barbieri and Metes paper shows that reported kidnappings were already well in decline when the ban was implemented. The number of reported kidnappings appears to have peaked at 73 in 1977 and was at fewer than 10 in 1990, the year before the ban went into effect (the number jumped to 12 in 1991). Unfortunately, the data published in Barbieri and Metes article does not appear to be available anywhere else for corroboration. But, based on their data, the year after the law went into effect, the number of kidnappings dipped to 1990 levels before increasing again in 1993 and finally tapering off after 1994.\nThe point is not to discount the number of kidnapping victims  one kidnapping victim is too many  but the law was implemented at a time when kidnappings in Italy were already in steep decline. Is it possible that the law helped accelerate that decline? Maybe, but it is hard to determine based on the numbers available.\nColombia first banned payment of kidnapping ransoms in 1993, at the start of the peak of kidnappings by the FARC-EP, a Marxist guerilla group. The measure was struck down soon after by a high court, which argued that any ban impinged on victim families right to privacy. But this was not just a problem for Colombian families; the problem extended to multinational corporations with expat employees in Colombia. In 2011, the Colombian government threatened to restrict any multinational company from conducting business that was found to pay ransom demands for kidnapped employees. This followed the kidnapping of 23 employees of the Canadian energy company Talisman Energy after reports that the company had struck a deal with the rebels of around $2.6 million to release the employees.\nNaturally, governments trying to avoid more kidnappings want to avoid feeding the incentive for groups to continue kidnapping people. Over time, a forceful ban on payment may decrease the amount of paid ransoms in some cases, but it has also meant that some of those who still pay ransoms simply refrain from reporting it. Instead, victims turn to private negotiators or security firms to get their loved ones back, seeing as they have less support from governments to recover their loved ones. Not only can this increase the problems severity for governments, but it can also reduce the visibility that they have into the problem. \nIn practice, some payments are already banned at the federal level when they concern  the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. However, these sanctions are more concerned with financial controls at the national level than with cybersecurity-based policy surrounding ransomware payments; as such, they are outside the scope of this evaluation.\nOption 2: Ransom Insurance\nAnother proposed tool against both ransomware and kidnapping ransoms is purchasing insurance plans through private means. Clients purchase kidnapping insurance to claim in the case that they are kidnapped, and policies typically cover ransom payments, medical insurance, and loss of income related to the kidnapping. In the case of ransomware, ransomware insurance typically covers ransom payments, attack restoration costs, as well as lost income.\nKidnapping insurance is a protection that is consistently popular with individuals and organizations traveling to regions where \"governments are weak and territory is disputed\". These individuals and organizations are particularly keen on getting insurance, especially considering that kidnapping is, unfortunately, on the rise once again in Colombia.\nSimilarly, the inability of law enforcement to stem the tide of ransomware attacks, in part due to the recalcitrance of the Russian government in arresting ransomware groups, has driven the adoption of cyber insurance.\nExperts from Kings College London and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) found that over time, the kidnapping insurance industry has shaped norms that decrease filed claims by protecting targets as well as de-incentivizing the use of physical violence. This approach has also been aided by crisis negotiation firms to handle ransom negotiations. On the other hand, these same experts found fewer positive effects from the ransomware insurance market, mostly given that this insurance market is still maturing. However, there is enough concern about cyber insurance interfering with reporting that a new proposed cybersecurity law in Massachusetts specially mentions cybersecurity companies, stating: This provision requires that cybersecurity insurers cannot place limits on the ability of the insured to notify the government of a cybersecurity incident or data breach.\nSome perceive that ransomware insurance will only worsen the problem of ransomware, as threat actors may target insured victims knowing that they have the funds to pay a ransom. Some ransomware groups have even claimed that they specifically look for victims who have cyber insurance (though one should always be skeptical of any claims from ransomware groups). An article by Kyle Logue and Adam Shniderman at the University Michigan argues that this is not always true, however, especially when insurers also implement hardening to their clients to reduce their cyber risk, processes that are also used in the kidnapping insurance market. They also posit that governments could regulate the ransomware insurance market to reduce criminal incentives (by banning ransom payment payouts but covering all other costs, for instance). Additionally, insurance companies can use data to gain insight into the security posture of their prospective clients and help assess their risk level. \nOn the whole, the ransomware insurance market is still developing when compared to the established kidnapping ransom market. It is principally an option for companies who are willing to implement an insurance companys security standards to transfer, rather than solely accepting or mitigating, the risk of a ransomware attack. \nOption 3: Mandate Reporting of Ransom Payments\nIn what is perhaps a middle ground between freezing the bank accounts of victims to prevent them from paying ransom and using private insurance solutions, a third option lies in mandating attacked entities to report attacks, regardless of whether or not they paid ransom amounts. Currently, we rely on a slew of different sources to cross-check the state of the ransomware environment. These sources include state-based filings (like New York), regulatory filings (like the new rule from the US Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] mandating cyberattack reports), and ransomware groups dark web extortion sites, among others. Put together, these ultimately produce a clear picture of the true state of ransomware. In the United Kingdom (UK), companies report incidents at the national level through a dedicated portal (the information of which is not available to the public). There is no single data source to assess who is being attacked, which group is attacking, and whether or not the victim paid ransom amounts. \nOne option to remediate this is mandating the reporting of ransomware attacks and submitted payments. For example, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) mandates that healthcare companies report breaches in certain circumstances and make a redacted version of that data available to anyone. Because of this policy, there is more insight into healthcare breaches in the United States than in any other sector. It is far from perfect, but it could serve as a good model to build upon. While mandating ransomware attacks and ransom reports would not be enough to stop the issue, it could create a higher degree of visibility into the problem. Such was the case during Colombias peace process following negotiations with guerilla groups. A key job of the council assembled to see the process through (abbreviated as the JEP) has been to investigate kidnappings.

This detailed reporting also helped the group pick out motivating trends and patterns from the groups kidnapping, including to finance the guerilla organization, to exchange kidnapped victims for captured FARC-EP combatants, and to acquire territorial control. \nOutlook: What Would Really Stop Ransomware Attacks?\nHow to stop ransomware attacks is a question that stakeholders in and out of the cybersecurity realm alike ask themselves when faced with daily reports of ransomware and data extortion victims.

In its latest campaign, which ran between October and December 2023, TAG-70 exploited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail servers in its targeting of over 80 organizations, primarily in Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine. This activity is reminiscent of other Russian-aligned threat groups such as BlueDelta (APT28) and Sandworm, which have targeted email solutions, including Roundcube, in previous campaigns.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_70_chart_28741e8d2b.png\" alt=\"tag-70-chart.png\"><em>Geographic spread of victims of TAG-70s Roundcube exploit in October 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>The compromised email servers represent a significant risk, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. They could expose sensitive information about Ukraine&#39;s war effort, its diplomatic relations, and its coalition partners. Moreover, the targeting of Iranian embassies in Russia and the Netherlands suggests a broader geopolitical interest in assessing Iran&#39;s diplomatic activities, especially regarding its support for Russia in Ukraine.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Recorded Futures Insikt Group has identified TAG-70, a threat actor likely operating on behalf of Belarus and Russia, conducting cyber-espionage against targeting government, military, and national infrastructure entities in Europe and Central Asia since at least December 2020. In its latest campaign, which ran between October and December 2023, TAG-70 exploited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail servers in its targeting of over 80 organizations, primarily in Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine. This activity is reminiscent of other Russian-aligned threat groups such as BlueDelta (APT28) and Sandworm, which have targeted email solutions, including Roundcube, in previous campaigns.\nGeographic spread of victims of TAG-70s Roundcube exploit in October 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe compromised email servers represent a significant risk, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. They could expose sensitive information about Ukraine's war effort, its diplomatic relations, and its coalition partners. Moreover, the targeting of Iranian embassies in Russia and the Netherlands suggests a broader geopolitical interest in assessing Iran's diplomatic activities, especially regarding its support for Russia in Ukraine. Similarly, espionage against Georgian government entities reflects interests in monitoring Georgia's aspirations for European Union (EU) and NATO accession.\nTo mitigate the risk posed by TAG-70's campaign, organizations should ensure that their Roundcube installations are patched and up-to-date, while actively hunting for indicators of compromise (IoCs) in their environments. The sophistication of TAG-70's attack methods and its targeting of government and military entities underscore the need for robust cybersecurity measures and proactive threat intelligence efforts. The widespread nature of TAG-70's activities and its potential impact on national security highlight the urgency for vigilance and preparedness among affected organizations and government agencies.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n  \n    Domains:\nbugiplaysec[.]com\nhitsbitsx[.]com\nocsp-reloads[.]com\nrecsecas[.]com\n        \nIP Addresses:\n38.180.2[.]23\n38.180.3[.]57\n38.180.76[.]31\n86.105.18[.]113\n176.97.66[.]57\n176.97.76[.]118\n176.97.76[.]129\n198.50.170[.]72\n    \nMalware Samples (SHA256):\n6800357ec3092c56aab17720897c29bb389f70cb49223b289ea5365314199a26\nea22b3e9ecdfd06fae74483deb9ef0245aefdc72f99120ae6525c0eaf37de32e  \n\n\n\nAppendix B  MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n    \n    Tactic: Technique    ATT&CK Code  \n  \n    Initial Access: Phishing    T1583.001  \n  \n    Execution: Exploitation for Client Execution    T1583.003  \n  \n    Persistence: Valid Accounts    T1583.004  \n  \n    Credential Access: Exploitation for Credential Access     T1566.002  \n  \n    Credential Access: Input Capture    T1203  \n      \n    Discovery: File and Directory Discovery    T1203  \n      \n    Collection: Email Collection    T1203  \n      \n    Command and Control: Non-Standard Port    T1203",

Meeting some of the ERG members face-to-face was a fantastic experience that added a personal touch to our interactions and strengthened our bonds. \nMohamed noted one of his favorite events he attended and the impact it had: the BEST employee resource group invited a dominant voice and scholar - Dr. Byron Lowens - to speak about privacy issues in a variety of contexts, such as wearable health technologies, people's reactions to data breaches, and how privacy concerns lead to disparate outcomes for marginalized populations. \nHe continued to say that this initiative not only highlighted the need to address sensitive issues and educate our workforce, but also inspired further academic research and community awareness.\nChallenges and Growth\nThe dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the threat landscape keeps me on my toes. - Mohamed\nMohamed explained how his time at Recorded Future has exposed him to many topics that he once had no experience with and the supportive environment he found here. Stepping into such a large organization as a new employee with all knowledge and experience required to perform requires a supportive and collaborative environment. And that's what BEST and Recorded Future offered.\nMonet added that her role not only has challenged her on a professional level but also on a personal level. Professionally, working in this environment has challenged me to stay abreast of the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, honing my skills and expertise in threat intelligence. Additionally, I've found that my work here has complimented my educational pursuitsI'm currently going back to school for Cybersecurity. Being able to apply what I study directly to my role has not only deepened my understanding but also enhanced my learning experience. It's a rewarding cycle of knowledge acquisition and practical application that has accelerated my professional development.\nJoin Us on Our Journey\nOur Futurists have a powerful message to anyone whos considering joining the field, making their next career move, learning something new, or getting involved in ERG work. \nGo for it. If I can do it, so can you. The opportunities for growth and learning are boundless, limited only by your willingness to step out of your comfort zone. - Mohamed\nMohamed at a Colorado Rapids Game and Monets Family Christmas\nIf you're seeking a space where you can contribute to spreading diversity and fostering understanding of our mission, the ERG is the perfect place for you. And as for the company itself, it's a fantastic environment with great colleagues and an even better culture. You'll find yourself surrounded by supportive teammates and opportunities for growth. - Monet\nWe look forward to sharing more stories from our team, showcasing the diverse paths that have led us here and the shared vision that propels us forward. Your story could be the next to inspire, challenge, and transform our industry.

Overall, defenders are urged to allocate more resources to combat GitHub abuse, and LIS is expected to play a more significant role in addressing the issue through policy changes and technical innovations.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

      "content:encoded": "<p>Elections bring out the best of us and the worst of us. It&#39;s a time of shifting opinions, heightened emotions, and political intrigue in any year, but especially so lately, as research indicates <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/05/05/reducing-pernicious-polarization-comparative-historical-analysis-of-depolarization-pub-87034\">polarization is increasing</a> globally. You may be well-versed at navigating these dynamics interpersonally, with friends and family, but are you prepared to respond to election season risks posed to your business?  More importantly, what can you really do in response? What should you do?</p><p>As with any business decision, cost matters. Sure, you may want to fight mis/disinformation online, but is it worth it? Lets start with some context. As you balance the tradeoffs of proactive versus reactive engagement with the information ecosystem consider the potential adversarial investment. 2019 estimates cite the annual cost of mis/disinformation to the global economy at <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/online-fake-news-costing-us-78-billion-globally-each-year/\">$78 billion</a> with stock losses of $39 billion. An <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2018/626087/IPOL_STU(2018)626087_EN.pdf\">EU report</a> stated Russia nexus disinformation sources paid for 170,000 political ads on Facebook between June 2015 and May 2017. A study by Cheq and the University of Baltimore estimated that at least $400 million is spent on advancing highly misleading or false political news globally, and in 2020, at least $200 million was spent in the US alone. This level of investment or more could be used to target the 2024 election cycle and subsequently, organizations caught in the crosshairs. </p><p>Adversaries certainly think these efforts are worthwhile, given the significant investment costs, but are there any metrics on disinformation efficacy? In terms of audience ability to discern information authenticity, a <a href=\"https://www.covidstates.org/reports/health-and-political-misperceptions-in-the-us\">2023 national survey</a> of nearly 25,000 participants reported only 8% were able to correctly identify political falsehoods; in terms of belief adoption, 41% of participants actively believed in at least one political falsehood presented. And in terms of spread, a <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-false-news-spreads-faster-truth\">2019 MIT study</a> suggests falsehoods are 70% more likely to be shared on social media and can reach its first audience six times faster. Mis/disinformation is demonstrably capable of reaching susceptible audiences and changing their perspectives.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Elections bring out the best of us and the worst of us. It's a time of shifting opinions, heightened emotions, and political intrigue in any year, but especially so lately, as research indicates polarization is increasing globally. You may be well-versed at navigating these dynamics interpersonally, with friends and family, but are you prepared to respond to election season risks posed to your business?  More importantly, what can you really do in response? What should you do?\nAs with any business decision, cost matters. Sure, you may want to fight mis/disinformation online, but is it worth it? Lets start with some context. As you balance the tradeoffs of proactive versus reactive engagement with the information ecosystem consider the potential adversarial investment. 2019 estimates cite the annual cost of mis/disinformation to the global economy at $78 billion with stock losses of $39 billion. An EU report stated Russia nexus disinformation sources paid for 170,000 political ads on Facebook between June 2015 and May 2017. A study by Cheq and the University of Baltimore estimated that at least $400 million is spent on advancing highly misleading or false political news globally, and in 2020, at least $200 million was spent in the US alone. This level of investment or more could be used to target the 2024 election cycle and subsequently, organizations caught in the crosshairs. \nAdversaries certainly think these efforts are worthwhile, given the significant investment costs, but are there any metrics on disinformation efficacy? In terms of audience ability to discern information authenticity, a 2023 national survey of nearly 25,000 participants reported only 8% were able to correctly identify political falsehoods; in terms of belief adoption, 41% of participants actively believed in at least one political falsehood presented. And in terms of spread, a 2019 MIT study suggests falsehoods are 70% more likely to be shared on social media and can reach its first audience six times faster. Mis/disinformation is demonstrably capable of reaching susceptible audiences and changing their perspectives. The World Economic Forum stated disinformation and erosion of social cohesion continue to be some of the biggest global risks in the Global Risks Report 2023. Further, experts predict disinformation will increasingly target voters of color in the upcoming election and there are mounting concerns about AI-generated disinformation influencing the election.\nAlthough this suggests mis and disinformation are mounting problems with potential real-world impact, it's a stretch to say this activity will impact all organizations risk; significant impact to businesses will be reserved for specific industries and potentially, specific organizations. Consider the role of pharmaceutical companies' relevance to the US electorate in the years following the pandemic.\nAs of 2020, a Pew Research survey found that 71% of Americans had heard of the rumor that COVID-19 was intentionally planned, and up to 25% believed the statement was at least probably true. A 2021 KFF study found that 78% of Americans were unsure about or believed at least 1 in 8 false statements presented to them about COVID-19, the pandemic, or vaccines. As of 2023, health misinformation continues to take its toll: CNN reported 20% or survey respondents believed it was definitely true that Covid-19 vaccines had killed more people than the virus itself. Russian state-backed disinformation campaigns were found to have targeted Pfizer and other vaccines; China also targeted US vaccines with disinformation about efficacy. Moreover, research suggests vaccine hesitancy was directly correlated with exposure to related misinformation. \nAs demonstrated, mis and disinformation can directly influence customer opinion and product uptake. Further, targeted disinformation campaigns may indirectly affect many businesses, influencing the reputation of industries your organization operates within.

We also dig into why intelligence matters greatly for enterprises committed to managing IAM cyber risk and potentially seizing competitive opportunities.</strong></p><p>The simplest method for obtaining unauthorized access to an information system is reusing stolen credentials. Its straightforward, doesnt require technical know-how, and generally, credentials are available for almost any network or service; thus, stolen credentials remain a hot commodity. Social engineering (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/phishing-statistics/\">phishing</a>) and software <a href=\"https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/2023/09/26/qualys-survey-of-top-10-exploited-vulnerabilities-in-2023\">vulnerability exploitation</a> are also effective but require more effort and investment. Threat actors (this label sounds sophisticated, but the opposite is typically true) tend toward laziness, so purchasing or otherwise acquiring stolen credentials is often the first and most desirable option. </p><p>Since the dawn of modern computing, identity verification has been a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581907000560\">vexing challenge</a>, and smartphones have only compounded the problem. <a href=\"https://www.techtimes.com/articles/287578/20230213/apple-google-and-microsoft-are-pushing-passkeys-password-less-future.htm\">Technology consortiums</a> continue to push for improved standards that obviate the need for passwords. Still, static credentials are stubbornly persistent, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) options only create a sliding scale of deterrence.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/leading_intelligence_winning_against_credential_theft_snake_illustration_9f1ac15f35.png\" alt=\"Leading with Intelligence: Winning Against Credential Theft\" style=\"margin: auto;\" /><em>Image provided by authors</em><br></p><h3 id=\"identity-intelligence\">Identity Intelligence</h3><p>Stolen credentials previously originated primarily from significant database breaches where passwords lived in plaintext or varying degrees of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)\">hash</a> that were generally easy to recover. Today, credentials are stolen from web browsers via <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/initial-access-brokers-key-to-rise-in-ransomware-attacks\">malicious infostealer code</a>. These malware families have names like RedLine and Vidar (marketing is essential when differentiating against competitors). Infostealers have been around for a decade or more. However, recently, bad actors realized infostealers effectively obtained credentials for business systems. </p><p>Of course, there is still plenty of money in ransomware and data extortion, so its a match made in criminal heaven. These stolen credentials enable an entire ecosystem - sold in buyer-friendly markets - of derivative goods and services. Searching for and purchasing corporate credentials (SaaS, Remote Desktop, VPN, etc.) has never been easier. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/leading_intelligence_winning_against_credential_theft_report_8bfbc21e1a.png\" alt=\"Russian Market\" style=\"margin: auto;\" /><em>Screenshot: Russian Market, courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><p>Its tempting to believe that infostealers are a fringe problem, a victim domain of the irresponsible, but the magnitude of stolen data suggests otherwise. Recorded Future detected <strong>one billion</strong> compromised credentials in the first half of 2023 alone, many of which led to significant business risk impacts. Approximately <strong>50 credentials</strong> are stolen on average per compromised device, translating to roughly <strong>20 million compromised devices</strong> in six months. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/leading_intelligence_winning_against_credential_theft_chart_ba0fe782d3.png\" alt=\"Infostealer initiated compromised credentials in 2023, courtesy of Recorded Future\" style=\"margin: auto;\" /><em>Chart: Infostealer initiated compromised credentials in 2023, courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><p>Of course, many of these credentials ripped from web browser authentication events lead to account takeover (ATO) of consumer services (think free movie binging, fraudulent payments, or social media contact spamming). However, enormous amounts of purloined business system credentials (e.g., VPN access, email passwords, etc.) often create derivative access to higher-value targets, like corporate infrastructure. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/leading_intelligence_winning_against_credential_theft_stolen_credentials_chart_06d7ea02ba.png\" alt=\"Chart: volumes of stolen credentials segmented by business system categories, courtesy of Recorded Future\" style=\"margin: auto;\" /><em>Chart: volumes of stolen credentials segmented by business system categories, courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><p>How does an infostealer end up on a perfectly healthy computer? Millennials that came of age during the height of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing - Napster, LimeWire, Gnutella, etc. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa\">Kazaa</a>, anyone?) remember that downloading music was treacherous, as files were often viruses in disguise. The situation hasnt changed much other than that P2P file sharing is less popular as kids now download directly from web servers, often in search of games and game add-ons. For example, when an employee takes their laptop home (or stays home post-Covid) and their child surreptitiously downloads the latest free Minecraft add-on, the installation file may include an infostealer. The infostealer works quickly, exporting pages of credentials to a central server for cataloging and sale.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/malvertising#:~:text=%5Buncountable%5D,advertisement%3B%20online%20advertisements%20containing%20malware\">Malvertising</a> and spam also account for partial infostealer installation success. Malvertising campaigns are not limited to popular games and cheats. Malvertising also targets victims with scareware (Install this Chrome update or bad things will happen to you), running campaigns linked to trending office and productivity software, and related updates.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/leading_intelligence_winning_against_credential_theft_malvertising_campaign_trends_42638bffa9.png\" alt=\"Chart: Malware filenames and malvertising campaign trends, courtesy of Recorded Future\" style=\"margin: auto;\" /><em>Chart: Malware filenames and malvertising campaign trends, courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><p>Tragically, anti-virus software typically does little to slow these infostealers down, as the chart below demonstrates. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/antivirus_software_indexed_charts_524c7088f9.png\" alt=\"Chart: anti-virus software installed on infostealer-infected systems\" style=\"margin: auto;\" /><em>Chart: anti-virus software installed on infostealer-infected systems</em></p><h3 id=\"security-challenges\">Security Challenges</h3><p><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/mfa\">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> has emerged as a partial identity and access management (IAM) solution in B2B and B2C, but the implementations often require meticulous oversight. Infostealers grab web session cookies and other meta-data to facilitate session cloning.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Editor's note: The following blog post originally appeared on Levi Gundert's Substack page.\nImage provided by authors\nThe following inspects the mechanics and economies of stolen credentials and current security approaches. We also dig into why intelligence matters greatly for enterprises committed to managing IAM cyber risk and potentially seizing competitive opportunities.\nThe simplest method for obtaining unauthorized access to an information system is reusing stolen credentials. Its straightforward, doesnt require technical know-how, and generally, credentials are available for almost any network or service; thus, stolen credentials remain a hot commodity. Social engineering (e.g., phishing) and software vulnerability exploitation are also effective but require more effort and investment. Threat actors (this label sounds sophisticated, but the opposite is typically true) tend toward laziness, so purchasing or otherwise acquiring stolen credentials is often the first and most desirable option. \nSince the dawn of modern computing, identity verification has been a vexing challenge, and smartphones have only compounded the problem. Technology consortiums continue to push for improved standards that obviate the need for passwords. Still, static credentials are stubbornly persistent, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) options only create a sliding scale of deterrence.\nImage provided by authors\n\nIdentity Intelligence\nStolen credentials previously originated primarily from significant database breaches where passwords lived in plaintext or varying degrees of hash that were generally easy to recover. Today, credentials are stolen from web browsers via malicious infostealer code. These malware families have names like RedLine and Vidar (marketing is essential when differentiating against competitors). Infostealers have been around for a decade or more. However, recently, bad actors realized infostealers effectively obtained credentials for business systems. \nOf course, there is still plenty of money in ransomware and data extortion, so its a match made in criminal heaven. These stolen credentials enable an entire ecosystem - sold in buyer-friendly markets - of derivative goods and services. Searching for and purchasing corporate credentials (SaaS, Remote Desktop, VPN, etc.) has never been easier. \nScreenshot: Russian Market, courtesy of Recorded Future\nIts tempting to believe that infostealers are a fringe problem, a victim domain of the irresponsible, but the magnitude of stolen data suggests otherwise. Recorded Future detected one billion compromised credentials in the first half of 2023 alone, many of which led to significant business risk impacts. Approximately 50 credentials are stolen on average per compromised device, translating to roughly 20 million compromised devices in six months. \nChart: Infostealer initiated compromised credentials in 2023, courtesy of Recorded Future\nOf course, many of these credentials ripped from web browser authentication events lead to account takeover (ATO) of consumer services (think free movie binging, fraudulent payments, or social media contact spamming). However, enormous amounts of purloined business system credentials (e.g., VPN access, email passwords, etc.) often create derivative access to higher-value targets, like corporate infrastructure. \nChart: volumes of stolen credentials segmented by business system categories, courtesy of Recorded Future\nHow does an infostealer end up on a perfectly healthy computer? Millennials that came of age during the height of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing - Napster, LimeWire, Gnutella, etc. (Kazaa, anyone?) remember that downloading music was treacherous, as files were often viruses in disguise. The situation hasnt changed much other than that P2P file sharing is less popular as kids now download directly from web servers, often in search of games and game add-ons. For example, when an employee takes their laptop home (or stays home post-Covid) and their child surreptitiously downloads the latest free Minecraft add-on, the installation file may include an infostealer. The infostealer works quickly, exporting pages of credentials to a central server for cataloging and sale.\nMalvertising and spam also account for partial infostealer installation success. Malvertising campaigns are not limited to popular games and cheats. Malvertising also targets victims with scareware (Install this Chrome update or bad things will happen to you), running campaigns linked to trending office and productivity software, and related updates.\nChart: Malware filenames and malvertising campaign trends, courtesy of Recorded Future\nTragically, anti-virus software typically does little to slow these infostealers down, as the chart below demonstrates. \nChart: anti-virus software installed on infostealer-infected systems\nSecurity Challenges\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) has emerged as a partial identity and access management (IAM) solution in B2B and B2C, but the implementations often require meticulous oversight. Infostealers grab web session cookies and other meta-data to facilitate session cloning. SMS-delivered validation codes are susceptible to SIM swapping, and humans remain a weak point in mobile app authorization due to a desire to be helpful or eliminate nagging prompts (prompt fatigue). \nOn the far end of the security spectrum, hardware tokens are the most effective at preventing MFA bypasses, but they represent cultural challenges in most industries outside of technology. The overhead cost of replacing hardware tokens for remote employees when lost or forgotten is a non-starter for many businesses. The advent of passkey technology offers a promising alternative, but broad adoption will likely require a forcing function. \nIn addition to MFA, identity intelligence automated into IAM solutions (e.g., Microsoft Azure AD, Okta Workflows, etc.) is required for quick detection and remediation when infostealers experience success targeting employee systems.   \nThe Risks\nHow should businesses think about managing IAM and the risk impacts from IAM failures? \nIn B2C, sponsored research suggests consumers are security conscious, particularly around ATO. Yet, where consumers have options, as in U.S. financial services, there is little incentive to care about ATO because consumers rarely bear the final cost of fraud (beyond time, which amounts to mild frustration). That paradigm is unlikely to change anytime soon. \nIn B2B, there is scant evidence (one recent study suggests a different conclusion) that a data breach has a long-term impact on reputation primarily because enterprise security is complex. All businesses experience varying degrees of security event impact. Even publicly traded companies dont experience sustained share price devaluation after large-scale data breaches. \nA ChatGPT summary of revenue loss caused by the recent MOVEit vulnerabilities reveals even brand impairment has a short life. \n\nThe MOVEit file transfer vulnerabilities do not appear to have created significant revenue loss for Progress Software, the company behind MOVEit. According to estimates, MOVEit Transfer and MOVEit Cloud accounted for less than 4% of the company's annual revenue. Furthermore, Progress Software reported that the business impact from the MOVEit attack was minimal, despite the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability that affected more than 2,100 organizations and exposed the data of at least 62 million people.
