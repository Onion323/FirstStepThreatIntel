This complexity, compounded by the need for various point solutions and securing board approval for funding, results in a tech stack where many tools don&#8217;t communicate effectively. To enhance speed and efficiency, a shift towards <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/extended-detection-and-response-xdr\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">XDR (eXtended Detection and Response) </a>is essential. XDR offers a roadmap to streamline operations, integrate tools, and automate responses, ultimately providing a cohesive and effective cybersecurity strategy.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 reasons why CISOs need to adopt XDR for enterprise cybersecurity.</p>\n<h2><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6217\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/XDR-Blog-infographics-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/XDR-Blog-infographics-300x300.png 300w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/XDR-Blog-infographics-150x150.png 150w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/XDR-Blog-infographics-55x55.png 55w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/XDR-Blog-infographics-45x45.png 45w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/XDR-Blog-infographics.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></h2>\n<h2>1.      Holistic Visibility</h2>\n<p>Traditional security measures often operate in silos, leaving critical gaps in visibility. XDR, on the other hand, takes a holistic approach by aggregating data from endpoints, networks, servers, and cloud resources, providing a panoramic view of the IT environment. This interconnected perspective enables security teams to uncover subtle anomalies that may have gone unnoticed when examined in isolation, revealing the potential for coordinated attacks.</p>\n<h2>2.      Automated Threat Detection</h2>\n<p>Speed is of the essence in cybersecurity, and XDR&#8217;s automated detection capabilities ensure that threats are identified almost immediately, minimizing the potential for damage. For instance, the rapid encryption of an entire network by ransomware can be swiftly halted by XDR&#8217;s ability to instantly detect unusual file activities, allowing security teams to respond with agility.</p>\n<h2>3.      Enhanced Response Capabilities</h2>\n<p>Once a threat is detected, XDR solutions integrate automated response tools, from isolating compromised systems to revoking unauthorized access. This rapid and efficient response can be a game-changer, as seen in the case of a breached user account conducting unauthorized transactions &#8211; XDR can automatically revoke the account&#8217;s permissions and alert the security team, preventing further damage.</p>\n<h2>4.      Reduced Alert Fatigue</h2>\n<p>Security professionals are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of alerts, many of which are false positives. XDR&#8217;s intelligent systems, however, prioritize genuine threats, curating a focused list of actual issues for the <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/contact-sales-person\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">security team</a> to address. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances the overall security posture by ensuring that resources are directed towards the most pressing concerns.</p>\n<h2>5.      Integrated Threat Intelligence</h2>\n<p>Cyber threats evolve at a breakneck pace, and XDR platforms provide real-time updates about global cyber threats, ensuring that an organization&#8217;s defenses are always current. This proactive approach can be particularly beneficial when a new malware variant emerges overseas, as the XDR system can be quickly updated to defend against it before it even reaches the enterprise&#8217;s region.</p>\n<h2>6.      Cloud-Native Security</h2>\n<p>As cloud adoption continues to rise, so do cloud-specific threats. XDR solutions ensure that cloud environments, often the backbone of modern businesses, are not left vulnerable. This is especially crucial in the wake of incidents caused by a misconfigured firewall in a cloud environment &#8211; a scenario that could potentially be averted with robust XDR coverage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/what-is-xdr-xdr-and-its-many-capabilities/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">Learn More About What is XDR? How does XDR work? How does XDR work? Benefits of XDR, EDR vs. XDR and EDR vs MDR vs XDR</a></p>\n<h2>7.      Flexibility and Scalability</h2>\n<p>Modern enterprises require security solutions that can seamlessly adapt to their changing scales and operations. XDR platforms are designed to handle this growth, ensuring that a startup&#8217;s transition into a multinational corporation can be secured without the need for a complete security overhaul.</p>\n<h2>8.      Reduced Complexity</h2>\n<p>Managing disparate security tools can be a logistical nightmare, but <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/extended-detection-and-response-xdr\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">XDR</a> amalgamates multiple functionalities into a unified dashboard, streamlining security operations. Instead of coordinating between different vendors for endpoint protection, network security, and cloud security, enterprises can now manage their defenses from a single, coherent platform.</p>\n<h2>9.      Contextual Analysis</h2>\n<p>XDR doesn&#8217;t just provide data; it offers insights. By piecing together information from various sources, XDR can provide a comprehensive narrative of a security event. For instance, if a user accesses sensitive data late at night, XDR can correlate this with unusual server communications and data transfers, painting a clearer picture of a potential data breach.</p>\n<h2>10. Continuous Evolution</h2>\n<p>Cyber adversaries are relentless in their pursuit of new vulnerabilities, and XDR solutions are designed to keep pace. The best XDR platforms learn and adapt from each security event, ensuring that their algorithms and defenses are constantly evolving to stay ahead of the curve. This adaptive intelligence can be particularly valuable in the aftermath of a sophisticated phishing scheme, as the XDR system updates its algorithms to provide even stronger protection against similar future threats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/10-reasons-why-cisos-must-leverage-xdr-for-enterprise-security/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\">10 Reasons Why CISOs Must Leverage XDR For Enterprise Security</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\">Blogs on Information Technology, Network &amp; Cybersecurity | Seqrite</a>.</p>\n",

XDR offers a roadmap to streamline operations, integrate tools, and automate responses, ultimately providing a cohesive and effective cybersecurity strategy.\nHere are 10 reasons why CISOs need to adopt XDR for enterprise cybersecurity.\n\n1.      Holistic Visibility\nTraditional security measures often operate in silos, leaving critical gaps in visibility. XDR, on the other hand, takes a holistic approach by aggregating data from endpoints, networks, servers, and cloud resources, providing a panoramic view of the IT environment. This interconnected perspective enables security teams to uncover subtle anomalies that may have gone unnoticed when examined in isolation, revealing the potential for coordinated attacks.\n2.      Automated Threat Detection\nSpeed is of the essence in cybersecurity, and XDR’s automated detection capabilities ensure that threats are identified almost immediately, minimizing the potential for damage. For instance, the rapid encryption of an entire network by ransomware can be swiftly halted by XDR’s ability to instantly detect unusual file activities, allowing security teams to respond with agility.\n3.      Enhanced Response Capabilities\nOnce a threat is detected, XDR solutions integrate automated response tools, from isolating compromised systems to revoking unauthorized access. This rapid and efficient response can be a game-changer, as seen in the case of a breached user account conducting unauthorized transactions – XDR can automatically revoke the account’s permissions and alert the security team, preventing further damage.\n4.      Reduced Alert Fatigue\nSecurity professionals are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of alerts, many of which are false positives. XDR’s intelligent systems, however, prioritize genuine threats, curating a focused list of actual issues for the security team to address. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances the overall security posture by ensuring that resources are directed towards the most pressing concerns.\n5.      Integrated Threat Intelligence\nCyber threats evolve at a breakneck pace, and XDR platforms provide real-time updates about global cyber threats, ensuring that an organization’s defenses are always current. This proactive approach can be particularly beneficial when a new malware variant emerges overseas, as the XDR system can be quickly updated to defend against it before it even reaches the enterprise’s region.\n6.      Cloud-Native Security\nAs cloud adoption continues to rise, so do cloud-specific threats. XDR solutions ensure that cloud environments, often the backbone of modern businesses, are not left vulnerable. This is especially crucial in the wake of incidents caused by a misconfigured firewall in a cloud environment – a scenario that could potentially be averted with robust XDR coverage.\nLearn More About What is XDR? How does XDR work? How does XDR work? Benefits of XDR, EDR vs. XDR and EDR vs MDR vs XDR\n7.      Flexibility and Scalability\nModern enterprises require security solutions that can seamlessly adapt to their changing scales and operations. XDR platforms are designed to handle this growth, ensuring that a startup’s transition into a multinational corporation can be secured without the need for a complete security overhaul.\n8.      Reduced Complexity\nManaging disparate security tools can be a logistical nightmare, but XDR amalgamates multiple functionalities into a unified dashboard, streamlining security operations. Instead of coordinating between different vendors for endpoint protection, network security, and cloud security, enterprises can now manage their defenses from a single, coherent platform.\n9.      Contextual Analysis\nXDR doesn’t just provide data; it offers insights. By piecing together information from various sources, XDR can provide a comprehensive narrative of a security event. For instance, if a user accesses sensitive data late at night, XDR can correlate this with unusual server communications and data transfers, painting a clearer picture of a potential data breach.\n10. Continuous Evolution\nCyber adversaries are relentless in their pursuit of new vulnerabilities, and XDR solutions are designed to keep pace. The best XDR platforms learn and adapt from each security event, ensuring that their algorithms and defenses are constantly evolving to stay ahead of the curve. This adaptive intelligence can be particularly valuable in the aftermath of a sophisticated phishing scheme, as the XDR system updates its algorithms to provide even stronger protection against similar future threats.\n \nThe post 10 Reasons Why CISOs Must Leverage XDR For Enterprise Security appeared first on Blogs on Information Technology, Network & Cybersecurity | Seqrite.",

Seqrite Labs APT team has discovered multiple such campaigns during telemetry analysis and hunting in the wild. One such threat group, SideCopy, has deployed its commonly used AllaKore RAT in three separate campaigns over the last few weeks, where two such RATs were deployed at a time in each campaign. During the same events, its parent APT group Transparent Tribe (APT36) continuously used Crimson RAT but with either an encoded or a packed version. Based on their C2 infrastructure, we were able to correlate these APTs, proving their sub-divisional relation once again. This blog overviews these campaigns and how a connection is established by looking at their previous attacks.</p>\n<p>India is one of the most targeted countries in the cyber threat landscape where not only Pakistan-linked APT groups like <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/sidecopys-multi-platform-onslaught-leveraging-winrar-zero-day-and-linux-variant-of-ares-rat/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">SideCopy</a> and APT36 (Transparent Tribe) have targeted India but also new spear-phishing campaigns such as Operation <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/operation-rusticweb-targets-indian-govt-from-rust-based-malware-to-web-service-exfiltration/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">RusticWeb</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.eclecticiq.com/operation-flightnight-indian-government-entities-and-energy-sector-targeted-by-cyber-espionage-campaign\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FlightNight</a> have emerged. At the same time, we have observed an increase in the sale of access to Indian entities (both government and corporate) by initial access brokers in the underground forums, high-profile ransomware attacks, and more than 2900 disruptive attacks such as DDoS, website defacement and database leaks by 85+ Telegram Hacktivist groups in the first quarter of 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>Threat Actor Profile</strong></p>\n<p>SideCopy is a Pakistan-linked Advanced Persistent Threat group that has been targeting South Asian countries, primarily the Indian defense and government entities, since at least 2019. Its arsenal includes Ares RAT, Action RAT, AllaKore RAT, Reverse RAT, Margulas RAT and more. Transparent Tribe (APT36), its parent threat group with the same persistent targeting, shares code similarity and constantly updates its Linux malware arsenal. Active since 2013, it has continuously used payloads such as Crimson RAT, Capra RAT, Eliza RAT and Oblique RAT in its campaigns.</p>\n<p><strong>SideCopy</strong></p>\n<p>So far, three attack campaigns with the same infection chain have been observed, using compromised domains to host payloads. Instead of side-loading the Action RAT (DUser.dll) payload, as seen previously, two custom variants of an open-source remote agent called <a href=\"https://github.com/maickonn/AllaKore_Remote\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">AllaKore</a> are deployed as the final payload.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6153 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"992\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1.png 992w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-266x300.png 266w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-768x867.png 768w, https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fig1-907x1024.png 907w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fig. 1 – Attack Chain of SideCopy</em></p>\n<p><strong>Infection Process</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Spear-phishing starts with an archive file containing a shortcut (LNK) in a double-extension format.</li>\n<li>Opening the LNK triggers the MSHTA process, which executes a remote HTA file hosted on a compromised domain.

After deobfuscation, we see C2 commands that are similar to the above Delphi-based AllaKore RAT deployed by SideCopy. Only this time it is in a .NET variant with the following five commands:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"143\"><strong>C2 Command</strong></td>\n<td width=\"348\"><strong>Function</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"143\">LIST_DRIVES</td>\n<td width=\"348\">Retrieve and send list of drives on the machine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"143\">LIST_FILES</td>\n<td width=\"348\">Enumerate files and folder in the given path</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"143\">UPLOAD_FILE</td>\n<td width=\"348\">Download and execute file</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"143\">PING</td>\n<td width=\"348\">Listening to C2 and send PONG for live status</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"143\">getinfo</td>\n<td width=\"348\">Send username, machine name and OS information</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Persistence is set in two ways, run registry key or through the startup directory.</p>\n<p>Overlap of code usability was found in SideCopy’s Linux-based stager payload of Ares RAT and that of Transparent Tribe’s Linux-based python malware called Poseidon and other desktop utilities. Here we see similar code overlaps and possibly sharing of C2 infrastructure between the two groups. AllaKore RAT (open source) has been associated with SideCopy since its discovery in 2019 along with Action RAT payload. Similarly, Crimson RAT is linked to be an in-house toolset of APT36.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure and Attribution</strong></p>\n<p>Looking at the C2, the same target names used previously by APT36 were identified that are running Windows Server 2012 and 2022 versions.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\"><strong>IP</strong></td>\n<td width=\"82\"><strong>ASN</strong></td>\n<td width=\"132\"><strong>Organization</strong></td>\n<td width=\"115\"><strong>Country</strong></td>\n<td width=\"163\"><strong>Name</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">204.44.124[.]134</td>\n<td width=\"82\">AS8100</td>\n<td width=\"132\">QuadraNet Inc</td>\n<td width=\"115\">United States</td>\n<td width=\"163\">WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">162.245.191[.]214</td>\n<td width=\"82\">AS8100</td>\n<td width=\"132\">QuadraNet Inc</td>\n<td width=\"115\">United States</td>\n<td width=\"163\">WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">155.94.209[.]4</td>\n<td width=\"82\">AS207083</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Quadranet Inc</td>\n<td width=\"115\">Netherlands</td>\n<td width=\"163\">WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"131\">176.107.182[.]55</td>\n<td width=\"82\">AS47987</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Zemlyaniy Dmitro Leonidovich</td>\n<td width=\"115\">Ukraine</td>\n<td width=\"163\">WIN-9YM6J4IRPC</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Based on this correlation and previous attack chains, these campaigns are attributed to both APT36 and SideCopy groups with high confidence, establishing yet another strong connection between them.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Persistent targeting of the Indian government and defense entities by Pakistan-linked APT groups has continued, where new operations have emerged with similar threats. SideCopy has deployed its well—associated AllaKore RAT in multiple campaigns, whereas its parent group, Transparent Tribe (APT36), is continuously using Crimson RAT, T, making changes to evade detections.</p>\n<p>As the threat landscape shifts due to various geopolitical events like the Israel-Iran conflict, India is bound to get targeted continuously. On the verge of India’s upcoming election, it is suggested that necessary precautions be taken and that people stay protected amidst the increasing cybercrime.</p>\n<p><strong>Seqrite

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Estimated reading time: 13 minutes\nIn the recent past, cyberattacks on Indian government entities by Pakistan-linked APTs have gained significant momentum. Seqrite Labs APT team has discovered multiple such campaigns during telemetry analysis and hunting in the wild. One such threat group, SideCopy, has deployed its commonly used AllaKore RAT in three separate campaigns over the last few weeks, where two such RATs were deployed at a time in each campaign. During the same events, its parent APT group Transparent Tribe (APT36) continuously used Crimson RAT but with either an encoded or a packed version. Based on their C2 infrastructure, we were able to correlate these APTs, proving their sub-divisional relation once again. This blog overviews these campaigns and how a connection is established by looking at their previous attacks.\nIndia is one of the most targeted countries in the cyber threat landscape where not only Pakistan-linked APT groups like SideCopy and APT36 (Transparent Tribe) have targeted India but also new spear-phishing campaigns such as Operation RusticWeb and FlightNight have emerged. At the same time, we have observed an increase in the sale of access to Indian entities (both government and corporate) by initial access brokers in the underground forums, high-profile ransomware attacks, and more than 2900 disruptive attacks such as DDoS, website defacement and database leaks by 85+ Telegram Hacktivist groups in the first quarter of 2024.\nThreat Actor Profile\nSideCopy is a Pakistan-linked Advanced Persistent Threat group that has been targeting South Asian countries, primarily the Indian defense and government entities, since at least 2019. Its arsenal includes Ares RAT, Action RAT, AllaKore RAT, Reverse RAT, Margulas RAT and more. Transparent Tribe (APT36), its parent threat group with the same persistent targeting, shares code similarity and constantly updates its Linux malware arsenal. Active since 2013, it has continuously used payloads such as Crimson RAT, Capra RAT, Eliza RAT and Oblique RAT in its campaigns.\nSideCopy\nSo far, three attack campaigns with the same infection chain have been observed, using compromised domains to host payloads. Instead of side-loading the Action RAT (DUser.dll) payload, as seen previously, two custom variants of an open-source remote agent called AllaKore are deployed as the final payload.\n\nFig. 1 – Attack Chain of SideCopy\nInfection Process\nSpear-phishing starts with an archive file containing a shortcut (LNK) in a double-extension format.\nOpening the LNK triggers the MSHTA process, which executes a remote HTA file hosted on a compromised domain. The stage-1 HTA contains two embedded files, a decoy and a DLL, that are base64 encoded.\nDLL is triggered to run in-memory where the decoy file is dropped & opened by it. As previously seen, the DLL creates multiple text files that mention the name “Mahesh Chand” and various other random texts.\nLater, the DLL will download two HTA files from the same compromised domain to begin its second stage process.\nBoth the HTA contain embedded files, this time an EXE and two DLLs.\n\nOne of the DLLs is executed in-memory, which drops the remaining two files into the public directory after decoding them. Persistence on the final payload is set beforehand via the Run registry key. One example:\nREG ADD “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” /V “issas” /t REG_SZ /F /D “C:\\Users\\Public\\issas\\issas.exe”\n\nFig. 2 – Files dropped in one of the campaigns\nLastly, both the final payloads, which is AllaKore RAT, are executed and connected with the same IP but different port numbers for C2 communication. The final DLL is not side-loaded but is completely legitimate and old file.\nAn in-depth analysis of each stage can be checked in our previous blogs and whitepapers. It contains timers for timeout, reconnection, clipboard, and separate sockets for desktop, files, and keyboard. The functionality of AllaKore includes:\nGathering system information\nEnumerating files and folders\nUpload and execute files\nKeylogging\nSteal clipboard data\nThe Delphi-based AllaKore RATs have the following details campaign-wise:\nCampaign\nInternal Name\nCompiler Timestamp\n\n\n1\nmsmediaGPview\nmsmediarenderapp\n06-Mar-2024\n\n\n2\nmsvideolib\nmsrenderapp\n18-Mar-2024\n\n\n3\nmsvideolib\nmsrenderapp\n01-Apr-2024\n\n\n\nInitially, the RAT sends and receives ping-pong commands, listening to the C2 for commands to know that the connection is alive. Both RAT payloads run together, complementing each other, as seen in the network traffic below. Their sizes are also different: one is 3.2 MB, and the other almost doubles to 7 MB, like Double Action RAT. A connection ID based on the system information is created for each instance.\n\nFig. 3 – Network traffic for port 9828\n\nFig. 4 – Network traffic for port 6663\nList of encrypted strings used for C2 communication in smaller-sized payloads:\nEncrypted\nDecrypted\n\n\n7oYGAVUv7QVqOT0iUNI\nSocketMain\n\n\n7oYBFJGQ\nOK\n\n\n7o4AfMyIMmN\nInfo\n\n\n7ooG0ewSx5K\nPING\n\n\n7ooGyOueQVE\nPONG\n\n\n7oYCkQ4hb550\nClose\n\n\n7oIBPsa66QyecyD\nNOSenha\n\n\n7oIDcXX6y8njAD\nFolder\n\n\n7oIDaDhgXCBA\nFiles\n\n\n7ooD/IcBeHXEooEVVuH4BB\nDownloadFile\n\n\n7o4H11u36Kir3n4M4NM\nUploadFile\n\n\nSx+WZ+QNgX+TgltTwOyU4D\nUnknown (Windows)\n\n\nQxI/Ngbex4qIoVZBMB\nWindows Vista\n\n\nQxI/Ngbex46Q\nWindows 7\n\n\nQxI/Ngbex4aRKA\nWindows 10\n\n\nQxI/Ngbex4KTxLImkWK\nWindows 8.1/10\n\n\n\nVarious file operations have been incorporated, including create, delete, execute, copy, move, rename, zip, and upload, which are part of the AllaKore agent. These commands were found in the bigger payload.\n\nFig. 5 – File move operation\n\nFig. 6 – Commands in the second payload\nThe DLL files dropped are not sideloaded by the AllaKore RAT, and they are legitimate files that could be later used for malicious purposes. These are Microsoft Windows-related libraries, but only a few contain a valid signature.\nDropped DLL Name\n\nPDB\nDescription\nCompilation Timestamp\n\n\nmsdr.dll\nWindows.Management.Workplace.WorkplaceSettings.pdb\nWindows Runtime WorkplaceSettings DLL\n2071-08-19\n\n\nbraveservice.dll\ndbghelp.pdb\nWindows Image Helper\n2052-02-25\n\n\nsalso.dll\nD3d12core.pdb\nDirect3D 12 Core Runtime\n1981-03-18\n\n\nsalso.dll\nOrtcEngine.pdb\nMicrosoft Skype ORTC Engine\n2020-01-07\n\n\nsalso.dll\nmsvcp120d.amd64.pdb\nMicrosoft® C Runtime Library\n2013-10-05\n\n\nFI_Ejec13234.dll\nIsAppRun.pdb\nTODO:\n2013-10-15\n\n\n\nDecoys\nTwo decoy files have been observed, where one was used in previous campaigns in February-March 2023. The date in the document, “21 December 2022,” has been removed, and the bait’s name has been changed to indicate March 2024 – “Grant_of_Risk_and_HardShip_Allowances_Mar_24.pdf.” As the name suggests, it is an advisory from 2022 on allowance grants to Army officers under India’s Ministry of Defence. This is used in two of the three campaigns.\n\nFig. 7 – Decoy (1)\nThe second decoy is related to the same allowance category and mentions payment in arrears form. This is another old document used previously, dated 19 January 2023.\n\nFig. 8 – Decoy (2)\nInfrastructure and Attribution\nThe compromised domains resolve to the same IP addresses used in previous campaigns, as seen with the passive DNS replication since last year.\nIP\nCompromised Domain\nCampaign\n\n\n151.106.97[.]183\ninniaromas[.]com\nivinfotech[.]com\nNovember 2023\n \n\n\nrevivelife.in\nMarch 2024\n\n\nvparking[.]online\nApril 2024\n\n\n162.241.85[.]104\nssynergy[.]in\nApril 2023\n\n\nelfinindia[.]com\nMay 2023\n\n\noccoman[.]com\nAugust 2023\n\n\nsunfireglobal[.]in\nOctober 2023\n\n\nmasterrealtors[.]in\nNovember 2023\n\n\nsmokeworld[.]in\nMarch 2024\n\n\n\nC2 servers of AllaKore RAT are registered in Germany to AS51167 – Contabo GmbH, commonly used by SideCopy. Based on the attack chain and arsenal used, these campaigns are attributed to SideCopy, which has high confidence and uses similar infrastructure to carry out the infection.\n164.68.102[.]44\nvmi1701584.contaboserver.net\n\n\n213.136.94[.]11\nvmi1761221.contaboserver.net\n\n\n\nThe following chart depicts telemetry hits observed for all three SideCopy campaigns related to AllaKore RAT. The first two campaigns indicate a spike twice in March, whereas the third campaign is observed during the second week of April.\n\nFig. 9 – SideCopy campaign hits\nTransparent Tribe\nMany Crimson RAT samples are seen regularly on the VirusTotal platform, with a detection rate of around 40-50. In our threat hunting, we have found new samples but have had very few detections.\n\nFig. 10 – Infection Chain of APT36\nAnalyzing the infection chain to observe any changes, we found that the Crimson RAT samples are not embedded directly into the maldocs as they usually are. This time, the maldoc in the XLAM form contained three objects: the decoy and base64-encoded blobs.\n\nFig. 11 – Additional Functions in Macro\nAfter extracting the VBA macro, we see additional functions for reading a file, decoding base64, and converting binary to string. The macro reads and decodes the two base64 blobs embedded inside the maldoc. This contains archived Crimson RAT executed samples, after which the decoy file is opened.\n\nFig. 12 – VBA infection flow\nCrimson RAT\nThe final RAT payloads contain the same functionality where 22 commands for C2 communication are used. As the detection rate is typically high for this Crimson RAT, we see a low rate for both these samples. These .NET samples have compilation timestamp of 2024-03-17 and PDB as:\n“C:\\New folder\\mulhiar tarsnib\\mulhiar tarsnib\\obj\\Debug\\mulhiar tarsnib.pdb”\nFig. 13 – Detection count on VT\nNo major changes were observed when the C2 commands were checked along with the process flow. IP of the C2 is 204.44.124[.]134, which tries to check the connection with 5 different ports – 9149, 15597, 18518, 26791, 28329. Below, you can find C2 commands for some of the recent samples (compile-timestamp-wise) of Crimson RAT, which uses similar 22 to 24 commands. All of these are not packed (except the last two) and have the same size range of 10-20 MB.\n\nFig. 14 – C2 commands of Crimson RAT for recent samples\nAs seen in BinDiff, similarity with previous samples is always more than 75%. Changes in the order of the command interpreted by the RAT were only found with numerical addition or splitting the command in two.\n\nFig. 15 – Comparing similarity between Crimson RAT variants\nAdditionally, two new samples that were obfuscated with Eziriz’s .NET Reactor were also found which are named ‘ShareX’ and ‘Analytics Based Card.’ APT36 has used different packers and obfuscators like ConfuserEx, Crypto Obfusator, and Eazfuscator, in the past. Compared with the previous iteration, the regular ones contain 22-24 commands as usual, whereas the obfuscated one contains 40 commands. The C2, in this case, is juichangchi[.]online trying to connect with four ports – 909, 67, 65, 121. A few of these C2 commands don’t have functionality yet, but they are similar to the ones first documented by Proofpoint. The list of all 22 commands and their functionality can be found in our previous whitepaper on APT36.\n\nFig. 16 – Comparison after deobufscation\nDecoys\nThe maldoc named “Imp message from dgms” contains DGMS, which stands for India’s Directorate General of Mines Safety. The decoy document contains various points relating to land and urban policies associated with military or defense, showing its intended targeting of the Indian Government. Another maldoc named “All details” is empty but has a heading called posting list.\n\nFig. 17 – DGMS decoy\nCrimson Keylogger\nA malicious .NET file with a similar PDB naming convention to Crimson RAT was recently seen, with a compilation timestamp of 2023-06-14. Analysis led to a keylogger payload that captures all keyboard activity.\nPDB: e:\\vdhrh madtvin\\vdhrh madtvin\\obj\\Debug\\vdhrh madtvin.pdb\nApart from capturing each keystroke and writing it into a file, it collects the name of the current process in the foreground. Toggle keys are captured separately and based on key combinations; clipboard data is also copied to the storage file.\n\nFig. 18 – Crimson Keylogger\nCorrelation\nSimilar to the code overlaps seen previously between SideCopy and APT36 in Linux-based payloads, based on the domain used as C2 by Transparent Tribe, we pivot to see passive DNS replications of the domain using Virus Total and Validin. The C2 for the above two packed samples resolved to different IPs – 176.107.182[.]55 and 162.245.191[.]214, as seen in the below timeline, giving us when they went live.\n\nFig. 19 – Timeline of C2 domain\nThis also leads us to two additional IP addresses: 155.94.209[.]4 and 162.255.119[.]207. The first one is communicating with a payload having detections of only 7/73 on Virus Total, whereas the latter is not associated with new malware. The malware seems to be another .NET Reactor packed payload with compile timestamp as 2039-02-24 but small (6.55 MB) compared to the Crimson RAT payloads.\n\nFig. 20 – Deobufscated AllaKore RAT\nThe default name of the sample is an Indian language word “Kuchbhi.pdb” meaning anything. After deobfuscation, we see C2 commands that are similar to the above Delphi-based AllaKore RAT deployed by SideCopy. Only this time it is in a .NET variant with the following five commands:\nC2 Command\nFunction\n\n\nLIST_DRIVES\nRetrieve and send list of drives on the machine\n\n\nLIST_FILES\nEnumerate files and folder in the given path\n\n\nUPLOAD_FILE\nDownload and execute file\n\n\nPING\nListening to C2 and send PONG for live status\n\n\ngetinfo\nSend username, machine name and OS information\n\n\n\nPersistence is set in two ways, run registry key or through the startup directory.\nOverlap of code usability was found in SideCopy’s Linux-based stager payload of Ares RAT and that of Transparent Tribe’s Linux-based python malware called Poseidon and other desktop utilities. Here we see similar code overlaps and possibly sharing of C2 infrastructure between the two groups. AllaKore RAT (open source) has been associated with SideCopy since its discovery in 2019 along with Action RAT payload. Similarly, Crimson RAT is linked to be an in-house toolset of APT36.\nInfrastructure and Attribution\nLooking at the C2, the same target names used previously by APT36 were identified that are running Windows Server 2012 and 2022 versions.\nIP\nASN\nOrganization\nCountry\nName\n\n\n204.44.124[.]134\nAS8100\nQuadraNet Inc\nUnited States\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n\n162.245.191[.]214\nAS8100\nQuadraNet Inc\nUnited States\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n\n155.94.209[.]4\nAS207083\nQuadranet Inc\nNetherlands\nWIN-P9NRMH5G6M8\n\n\n176.107.182[.]55\nAS47987\nZemlyaniy Dmitro Leonidovich\nUkraine\nWIN-9YM6J4IRPC\n\n\n\nBased on this correlation and previous attack chains, these campaigns are attributed to both APT36 and SideCopy groups with high confidence, establishing yet another strong connection between them.\nConclusion\nPersistent targeting of the Indian government and defense entities by Pakistan-linked APT groups has continued, where new operations have emerged with similar threats. SideCopy has deployed its well—associated AllaKore RAT in multiple campaigns, whereas its parent group, Transparent Tribe (APT36), is continuously using Crimson RAT, T, making changes to evade detections.\nAs the threat landscape shifts due to various geopolitical events like the Israel-Iran conflict, India is bound to get targeted continuously. On the verge of India’s upcoming election, it is suggested that necessary precautions be taken and that people stay protected amidst the increasing cybercrime.\nSeqrite

These features include:</p>\n<h2>1. Protection from Threats Spread via Email</h2>\n<p>An organization&#8217;s endpoint protection must include scanning every email attachment to safeguard against attacks, such as phishing. Advanced endpoint security solutions employ robust email scanning capabilities to detect and block malicious attachments, ensuring that users are protected from email-based threats.</p>\n<h2>2. Protection from Malicious Web Downloads</h2>\n<p>Advanced endpoint security solutions analyze incoming and outgoing web traffic to identify and block malicious web downloads before they can be executed on endpoints. By providing browser protection, these tools prevent users from inadvertently downloading malware or visiting compromised websites.</p>\n<h2>3.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Estimated reading time: 5 minutes\nGhost Locker is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (Raas) created by GhostSec [hacktivist groups]. In October 2023, GhostSec launched the GhostLocker framework. After their successful collaborative operations with the Stormous ransomware group in July 2023, GhostLocker ransomware operators provide various options for their affiliates.\nGhost Locker 2.0 is a new strain of ransomware that exfiltrates and encrypts the victim’s files and demands a ransom for the decryption key needed to unlock the files. We have observed it impacting countries like Brazil, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Turkey, and many others.\nTechnical Analysis: \nSeqrite has observed the two variants of Ghost Locker ransomware in the wild during threat hunting. Ghost Locker version 1.0 was written in Python-based script, and 2.0 is written in Golang.\nVariant 1:\nDuring the initial execution, this variant obtains the Windows Startup folder and copies itself to that folder to establish persistence.\n\nFig 1: Creating persistence\nAfter that, it obtains the list of drives mounted in the victim’s machine to utilize during the encryption process.\n\nFig 2: Obtaining driver list\nIt also generates a random string of 32 bytes and uses it as ID in the Ransomware JSON file. The threat actors use this ID in their control panel for identifying an infected machine.\n\nFig 3: Creating ID\nThe ransomware establishes connection to the threat actor C2 Server via the URL “hxxp[://]41[.]216[.]183[.]31[/]incrementLaunch,” in order to notify the threat actor that one more victim machine is in their list [control panel of Ghost Locker].\n\nFig 4: C2 connection\nThis Ghost Locker variant generates a Secret key using Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm. The generated Secret key is sent to the threat actor via JSON file and used while encrypting the files.\n\nFig 5: Generating Secret key\nAfter that, the ransomware generates the victim’s IP address, encryption ID, infection date, and other information from its configuration parameters, including encryption status, and gathers the ransom amount and a victim identifier string.\nThe ransomware creates a JSON file in the victim’s machine and stores the above details.\n\nFig 6: Generating JSON file\nThe generated JSON file is then sent to the C2 server through the URL “hxxp[://]41[.]216[.]183[.]31[/]addInfection” to register victim machine in that C2 panel.\n\nFig 7: Register the infected machine with a C2 panel\nThis variant verifies if the infected system has Administrative rights. If not, it obtains them through the takeown utility for accessing file systems, such as read and delete.\n \nFig 8: Obtain ownership through takeown\nAs shown in Fig 9 below, it skips the “C:\\Windows” folder, “new-mains.exe,” as well “.ghost” extension files during the encryption process.\n \nFig 9: Skipping files and folder\nThis ransomware uses an AES encryption algorithm and a key length of 256 bits. It encrypts the file in memory, creates a copy of the encrypted file on disk with the “.ghost” extension, and then deletes the original file.\n\nFig 10: Encryption process\nOnce the encryption process is completed, the ransomware drops the embedded ransom note to an HTML file named “Ransomnote.html” on the victim’s desktop and launches it with the Windows ‘Start’ command.\n \nFig 11: Ransomware note\nVariant 2: \nThis Ghost locker variant is largely Golang-based. The majority of the ransomware functionality remains the same as that of Variant 1.\nThe differences between these two Ghost Locker variants are:\nC2 servers have changed: from hxxp:[//]41[.]216[.]183.31[/](Fig 7) C2 server in variant 1, to hxxp[://]94[.]103[.]91[.]246[/] C2 server in variant 2.\nExecution: Variant 1 executes even without a successful connection to the C2 server. However, Variant 2 executes completely only if the victim machine is able to establish a successful connection with the C2.\nUsername in JSON file: The Username is zero in variant 1 and ghostsec in variant 2 in the generated JSON file in memory. A different affiliate apparently generated this ransomware binary with different configurations through this ransomware builder.\nExfiltration: As shown in Fig 13, Variant 2 kills the threat actor-defined services and processes to evade detection; the threat actor-defined target files for encryption and exfiltration are .doc, .docx, .xls, and .xlsx.\nSkipping File: As mentioned in Fig 9, variant 1 added the “new-mains.exe” file to the skip list during the encryption process, but variant 2 did not.\nAs mentioned in Fig 1 and 3, this Ghost locker variant also copies itself to the Windows Startup folder in order to establish persistence and generates a random string of 32 bytes for ID in the JSON File.\nOnce the infected machine is registered with the C2 panel, the ransomware sample strives to terminate the defined processes list or services [threat actor defined list while building the ransomware samples] on the victim’s machine.\n\n\nFig 12: Functions to kill TA-defined services and processes\nIt looks for the target files on the victim’s machine using the file extension list defined by the threat actor. Before the encryption routine begins, it uploads the target files to the C2 server via the URL, as shown in Figure 13, using the HTTP post method. In this variant, the actor exfiltrated and encrypted the files with .doc, .docx, .xls, and .xlsx extensions.\n\nFig 13: Exfiltrate the TA-specified files to the C2 server\nIOCS:\nC30A14B595FA334084CD32FA60B3C827\n8AD67A1B7A5F2428C93F7A13A398E39C\nhxxp[:]//94[.]103[.]91.246[/]incrementLaunch\nhxxp[://]41[.]216[.]183[.]31[/]incrementLaunch\nhxxp[:]//94[.]103[.]91.246[/]addInfection\nhxxp[://]41[.]216[.]183[.]31[/]addInfection\nDetections:\nRansom.Ghostlockr.S32894932\nYara rule: \nimport “pe”\nrule Ghost_locker\n{\nstrings:\n//$s2={06 6F ?? 00 00 0A 28 ?? 00 00 0A 28 ?? 00 00 0A 28 ?? 00 00 06 26}\n$s1={3C 74 69 74 6C 65 3E 47 68 6F 73 74 4C 6F 63 6B 65 72 20 4E 6F 74 65 3C 2F 74 69 74 6C 65 3E}\n$s2={68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 2F 61 64 64 49 6E 66 65 63 74 69 6F 6E}\n$s3={68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 2F 69 6E 63 72 65 6D 65 6E 74 4C 61 75 6E 63 68}\n$s4={3C 61 20 68 72 65 66 3D 22 68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 2F 76 69 63 74 69 6D 63 68 61 74 3F 69 64 3D 5B 45 4E 43 52 59 50 54 49 4F 4E 49 44 5D 22 3E 43 6C 69 63 6B 20 6D 65 3C 2F 61 3E}\n$s5={2E 67 68 6F 73 74 }\nCondition: All of them} \nMITRE ATTACK TTPs: \nTactic\nTechnique / Procedure\n\n\nExecution\nT1059.003: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\n \n\n\nDiscovery\nT1007: System Service Discovery\n\n\n\nT1082: System Information Discovery\n\n\n\nT1083: File and Directory Discovery\n\n\nCommand and Control\nT1071: Application Layer Protocol\n\n\nExfiltration\nT1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n \n\n\nImpact\nT1486: Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n\n\nT1489: Service Stop\n\n\n\nT1490: Inhibit System Recovery\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nGhost Locker is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (Raas) that has switched from Python script to Go language.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Estimated reading time: 4 minutes\nRecently, we came across a new banking trojan called Coyote, which utilizes a tool/library called Squirrel Installer, developed to install and manage updates of windows applications. The malware looks more evolved than our normal banking trojans and can potentially be at a higher threat level in the coming days. \nSome Background: \nThis newly found trojan targets different Brazilian Banking Institutions and points out the market it focuses on. The interesting thing is the involvement of Squirrel Installer. In the initial stage, it disguises itself as an update packager, and once executed, it sideloads the malicious code.  \nThe end payload is written in .NET. Coyote Trojan works on loading the CLR (Common Language Runtime) and running the decrypted assembly with the help of it. This all happens in memory to evade possible AV detections. \nAnalysis: \nOn checking the malicious dll being loaded, we found that almost all the files’ exports point to the same code; this may increase the chance of execution (Fig1). \nMd5 of the dll being discussed- 03eacccb664d517772a33255dff96020 \n\nFig1. Similar code in exports \nOn dynamic analysis of the DLL, we got an msil payload in memory, which was dumped for further analysis. \n\nFig2. Msil extracted from memory \nExtracted file – ae688dff6f64f1317af09641ae037300  \nMSIL Payload: \nOn checking the MSIL file statically, we can see a list of base64 strings, which are called as per their index. \n\nFig3. Code being called as per index \n\nFig4. Table of base64 strings\nThese are AES obfuscated strings that are decrypted by the below routine: \n\nFig5. AES decryption routine\nIn this process, each array undergoes conversion from base 64. The initial 16 bytes are extracted and allocated to array2, while the rest of the array constitutes encrypted code referred to as array3. Each file possesses a unique key, with array2 serving as the Initialization Vector for decrypting array3. \nBehavior: \nThe payload achieves persistence by adding itself to HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript \n\nFig6. Addition in UserInitMprLogonScript to achieve persistence\nWhile running, it takes the value of foregroundwindow, i.e., the current screen a user is working on, and compares it with some banking application name, which are hardcoded in the application. Hardcoded names belong to different Brazilian banking institutes. If a user visits any of them, the trojan tries to establish a connection to the CnC server with some details like respective banking application details, Machine name etc. \n\n  Fig7. Brazilian institutions targeted \nCommand and Control: \nBefore connecting to CnC, Coyote imports an embedded X.509certificate from its resource. This certificate is kept encrypted and used in the communication for the authentication and encryption process. \n\nFig8. Importing Certificate for Communication \n\nFig9. Attempt to CnC Connect once the user visits specific websites (Banking Related) \nIf the connection is successful, the attacker sends a response string with the action that must be performed on the infected system, along with some other details. This response string contains a random separator to split the string. \n\nFig10. Processing the string data received from CnC\nThe length of the first split string determines what action the trojan will take on the system. We have observed around 25 or more actions that are supported by it. \n\nFig11. Operation on the infected system as specified in the CnC response \nBelow is the list of some of the actions Coyote is capable of: \nLength \nAction \n\n\n10 \nDisconnect the connection \n\n\n12 \nTaking screenshots and uploading them to servers \n\n\n14 \nSetting a window as a foreground \n\n\n15 \nMinimize the window identified by the handle \n\n\n16 \nAttempting to bring a window to the foreground and then show it as usual. \n\n\n17 \nKill the process \n\n\n18 \nManipulating windows, E.g., Maximize \n\n\n21 \nStarting a process with a handle \n\n\n22 \nSetting the Registry values in the Current User space. \n\n\n23 \nSimulating mouse actions, such as click \n\n\n24 \nSimulate keyboard events \n\n\n26 \nDisable Desktop Window Manager (DWM) composition \n\n\n27 \nExecutes a delegate in this thread \n\n\n31 \nKey-logging \n\n\n33 \nHandle keyboard commands \n\n\n34 \nIterate over Registry Entries \n\n\n\nConclusion: \nCoyote Trojan has unlocked a new evolution in banking trojan code, where the malware authors resort to new, more complex techniques than we have typically seen.  \nMITRE ATT&CK TTPs:  \nT.1583.004 \nAcquire Infrastructure \n\n\nT.1037.001 \nBoot or Logon Initialization Scripts \n\n\nT.1574.002 \nDLL Side-Loading \n\n\nT1113 \nScreenCapture  \n\n\nT1041 \nExfiltration Over C2 Channel \n\n\n\nIOCs captured: \n5134e6925ff1397fdda0f3b48afec87b \nbf9c9cc94056bcdae6e579e724e8dbbd \n3f27458d01eb53991770f18983a11a52  \nc00d8ec2f585c6197b8083951c504e50  \n7608ab0f1f07dc5842800fdebb0c372c \n03eacccb664d517772a33255dff96020 \n071b6efd6d3ace1ad23ee0d6d3eead76 \n276f14d432601003b6bf0caa8cd82fec \nURLs: \ncarfilmenew[.]com \ncarroderua[.]com \npepapigdesenho[.]com \nnenembebe[.]com \ncarroeletrificante[.]com \nYou are protected: \nSeqrite engine detects Coyote Trojan IOCs as Trojan.Coyote.S32693555 and Trojan.Coyote.S32879971 \nAuthor: \nKirti Kshatriya \nCo-author: \nPrashil Moon \n \n \nThe post Exposing Coyote: The Next-Gen Banking Trojan Revolutionizing Cyber Threats in Brazil appeared first on Blogs on Information Technology, Network & Cybersecurity | Seqrite.",
