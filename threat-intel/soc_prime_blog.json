According to the research, the adversary activity has been active since the first decade of June and can be linked to the TellYouThePass ransomware operations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TellYouThePass is a basic ransomware strain that has been in the cyber threat arena for half a decade. The ransomware has made a comeback, coinciding with the exploitation of <a href=\"https://socprime.com/blog/cve-2021-45046-cve-2021-44228-detection-vulnerabilities-in-log4j-java-library/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Log4j vulnerabilities</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Imperva analysis uncovered a set of offensive TellYouThePass attacks aimed at uploading web shells and distributing malicious samples on impacted instances. Ransomware operators exploited CVE-2024-3577 to run arbitrary PHP code on the impacted devices. They used the latter to run an HTML application file hosted on the adversary web server via the mshta.exe binary. Mshta.exe, a native Windows <a href=\"https://socprime.com/blog/what-are-lolbins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LOLBin</a> capable of executing remote payloads, suggests that the attackers are leveraging a “living-off-the-land” approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TellYouThePass ransomware leveraged in the most recent campaign appears in the form of .NET samples delivered via HTML applications. The infection flow begins with the delivery of an HTA file with the malicious VBScript. Upon activation, the ransomware sends an HTTP request to the C2 server, concealing device details within what appears to be a request for CSS resources to evade detection. It also generates a &#8220;READ_ME10.html&#8221; ransom note, offering instructions for recovering files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mitigate the risks of emerging ransomware attacks defenders recommend staying constantly vigilant and timely implementing vulnerability patching. Since in-the-wild attacks leveraging CVE-2024-4577 might have already <a href=\"https://censys.com/cve-2024-4577/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">exposed 450K+ PHP servers</a>, primarily hosted in the U.S. and Germany, according to stats by Censys, it&#8217;s imperative to strengthen enterprise security.

Adversaries weaponize the flaw to upload web shells and distribute TellYouThePass ransomware on compromised instances.\nDetect TellYouThePass Ransomware Campaign\nIn light of the newly uncovered PHP-CGI bug being swiftly weaponized for in-the-wild attacks, facilitating the distribution of TellYouThePass ransomware, security professionals must proactively address this emerging threat. To detect potential TellYouThePass intrusions in their earliest stages, the SOC Prime Platform for collective cyber defense provides a dedicated set of Sigma rules.\nJust hit the Explore Detections button below and immediately drill down to the relevant detection stack compatible with 30+ SIEM, EDR, and Data Lake technologies. All the rules are enriched with actionable CTI, accompanied by extensive metadata, and mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework to smooth out the threat investigation. \nExplore Detections \nWith TellYouThePass operators being among the first to leverage the CVE-2024-4577 bug in ongoing campaigns, cyber defenders might expect further weaponization attempts for this flaw. To detect associated exploits, use a Sigma rule listed below. \nPossible CVE-2024-4577 (PHP Remote Code Execution) Exploitation Attempt (via webserver)\nFor those seeking more curated content addressing the Proactive Vulnerability Detection use case, SOC Prime Platform aggregates the largest collection of curated algorithms available with this link.\nTellYouThePass Ransomware Attack Analysis\nThe Imperva Threat Research team recently notified the global cyber defender community of ongoing attacks weaponizing the critical PHP flaw known as CVE-2024-4577 to further infect the target instances with ransomware. According to the research, the adversary activity has been active since the first decade of June and can be linked to the TellYouThePass ransomware operations. \nTellYouThePass is a basic ransomware strain that has been in the cyber threat arena for half a decade. The ransomware has made a comeback, coinciding with the exploitation of Log4j vulnerabilities.\nThe Imperva analysis uncovered a set of offensive TellYouThePass attacks aimed at uploading web shells and distributing malicious samples on impacted instances. Ransomware operators exploited CVE-2024-3577 to run arbitrary PHP code on the impacted devices. They used the latter to run an HTML application file hosted on the adversary web server via the mshta.exe binary. Mshta.exe, a native Windows LOLBin capable of executing remote payloads, suggests that the attackers are leveraging a “living-off-the-land” approach.\nThe TellYouThePass ransomware leveraged in the most recent campaign appears in the form of .NET samples delivered via HTML applications. The infection flow begins with the delivery of an HTA file with the malicious VBScript. Upon activation, the ransomware sends an HTTP request to the C2 server, concealing device details within what appears to be a request for CSS resources to evade detection. It also generates a “READ_ME10.html” ransom note, offering instructions for recovering files.\nTo mitigate the risks of emerging ransomware attacks defenders recommend staying constantly vigilant and timely implementing vulnerability patching. Since in-the-wild attacks leveraging CVE-2024-4577 might have already exposed 450K+ PHP servers, primarily hosted in the U.S. and Germany, according to stats by Censys, it’s imperative to strengthen enterprise security. SOC Prime’s complete product suite for AI-powered Detection Engineering, Automated Threat Hunting, and Detection Stack Validation serves as an all-in-one solution to proactively defend against emerging and persistent threats and equip your organization with advanced defensive capabilities to disrupt adversaries before they strike.\n\nThe post TellYouThePass Ransomware Attack Detection: Hackers Exploit CVE-2024-4577 to Install Web Shells and Drop Malware  appeared first on SOC Prime.",

Among them, notorious russia&#8217;s state-sponsored hacking groups, like <a href=\"https://socprime.com/search/apt28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">APT28</a>, <a href=\"https://socprime.com/search/apt29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">APT29</a>, and <a href=\"https://socprime.com/search/Gamaredon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gamaredon</a>, continued to use Ukraine as a testing ground to further expand their attack surface to European and North American political arenas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, in October 2023, russian APT28 <a href=\"https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hacked</a> the public &amp; private sectors in France, using the same vulnerabilities and TTPs as in Ukraine during 2022-2023. Also, in May 2024, Germany revealed a long-lasting campaign by APT28, drawing condemnation from the European Union (E.U.), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the U.K. According to <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/russia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CISA</a>, russia will remain a top cyber threat by fusing cyber espionage, influence, and attack capabilities and keeping its primary focus on targeting critical infrastructure in the U.S. as well as in allied and partner countries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, while cyber-espionage remains a priority, APTs increasingly switch to intellectual property theft, financial gain, or destructive campaigns. The targets now extend beyond public sector institutions and large corporations, with small and middle-sized businesses becoming juicy targets. According to <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document/Accenture-State-Cybersecurity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Accenture</a>, 97% of organizations saw an increase in cyber threats since the start of the russia-Ukraine war in 2022, demonstrating the profound effect of geopolitical tensions on business globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expansion of the APT attack surface is only a facet of the ever-growing threat landscape organizations are currently coping with. The number of vulnerabilities weaponized for in-the-wild attacks increases tremendously on a yearly basis, with over 30K new flaws being discovered solely in 2023. Statista <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/204457/businesses-ransomware-attack-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">states</a> that 72,7% of organizations fell prey to ransomware attacks last year.

To provide organizations with instant access to curated detection rules, hunting queries, and IOC collections bundled with actionable CTI and smart solutions, we have released a new licensing model backed by the Fair Usage Policy. The new policy is intended to tackle and eliminate the bandwidth restrictions related to content unlocking, which have been a major concern with our previous token-based model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a class=\"button mt-4 border-green\" style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"https://tdm.socprime.com/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Explore New Pricing Model</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maximize the Value of Your Enterprise Subscription with Unrestricted Access at No Extra Cost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafting detection rules and queries has traditionally been more art than science, with many enterprises relying on expensive professional services to accomplish this task. Before we introduced crowdsourcing and launched our <a href=\"https://my.socprime.com/tdm-developers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Threat Bounty Program</a>, producing a single detection rule was both time-consuming and expensive, often taking days and costing up to thousands of U.S. dollars. However, with the advent of <a href=\"https://my.socprime.com/sigma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sigma</a> rules, the rise of <a href=\"https://roota.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roota</a> and the Uncoder translation engine, and the power of crowdsourcing, the price of developing a detection algorithm has dramatically decreased year over year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When SOC Prime started, we had roughly 150 rules in the <a href=\"https://my.socprime.com/threat-detection-marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Threat Detection Marketplace</a> content library in 2016. In 2024, we surpassed 13,000 TTP-based Sigma rules and roughly 300,000+ native rules for SIEM, EDR, and now Data Lakes, all documented and linked to MITRE ATT&amp;CK®. As production costs decrease, we can achieve a significant milestone by separating cost considerations from detection engineering decision-making. In light of the new reality, we’ve come up with the Fair Usage Policy that reflects our mission to foster transformational change in threat detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fair Usage Policy within the newly released Enterprise Licensing model enables any organization to access up to 4,172 rules per year without any limits or concerns about the token expenditure.

This feature contributes to efficient access management, enhanced security, and scalability to adapt to organizational changes, simplifies compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards, and eliminates the administrative burden related to access management.\nExtended Support & Professional Services\nWe have extended customer support and professional services bundled with your Enterprise subscription to provide smooth onboarding, quick time-to-value, and fast implementation of SOC Prime’s product suite into your existing workflow. \nOur engineering team of seasoned experts ensures you drive maximum value from the SIEM, EDR, or XDR in use, have complete visibility into your data, collect and parse all necessary logs, and take your SOC Prime platform experience to the next level.\nSOC Prime’s Professional Services Team includes seasoned experts with 20+ years of experience in the practical implementation of market-leading SIEM technologies, including Elastic, Microsoft, Splunk, QRadar, and Falcon LogScale/Humio for scaling up to 50 terabytes a day, with the 24/7 support provided for hundreds of companies, including government organizations in Europe and the U.S. \nWhile we provide traditional support by email or live chat to address any requests or stumbling blocks you might experience, we also accommodate community-driven remote workflows via our Discord channel. \nFor large-scale projects, we work with 34+ MDR partners to accelerate their security offerings and ensure you get best-in-class follow-the-sun detection engineering operations and 24-hour threat coverage to safeguard your enterprise against any existing or emerging threats.\n\nThe post SOC Prime Introduces a Fair Usage Policy appeared first on SOC Prime.",
