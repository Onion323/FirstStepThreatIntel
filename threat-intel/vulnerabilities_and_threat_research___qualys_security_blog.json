CVE assigned to this vulnerability is <strong>CVE-2024-6387.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability, which is a signal handler race condition in OpenSSH&#8217;s server (sshd), allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as root on glibc-based Linux systems; that presents a significant security risk. This race condition affects sshd in its default configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-35841\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on searches using Censys and Shodan, we have identified over 14 million potentially vulnerable OpenSSH server instances exposed to the Internet. Anonymized data from Qualys CSAM 3.0 with External Attack Surface Management data reveals that approximately 700,000 external internet-facing instances are vulnerable. This accounts for 31% of all internet-facing instances with OpenSSH in our global customer base. Interestingly, over 0.14% of vulnerable internet-facing instances with OpenSSH service have an End-Of-Life/End-Of-Support version of OpenSSH running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our security analysis, we identified that this vulnerability is a regression of the previously patched vulnerability CVE-2006-5051, which was reported in 2006. A regression in this context means that a flaw, once fixed, has reappeared in a subsequent software release, typically due to changes or updates that inadvertently reintroduce the issue. This incident highlights the crucial role of thorough regression testing to prevent the reintroduction of known vulnerabilities into the environment. This regression was introduced in October 2020 (OpenSSH 8.5p1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualys has developed a working exploit for the regreSSHion vulnerability. As part of the disclosure process, we successfully demonstrated the exploit to the OpenSSH team to assist with their understanding and remediation efforts. We do not release our exploits, as we must allow time for patches to be applied. However, even though the exploit is complex, we believe that other independent researchers will be able to replicate our results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"about-openssh-securing-enterprise-communications-and-infrastructure\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>About OpenSSH: Securing Enterprise Communications and Infrastructure</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell) is a suite of secure networking utilities based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which is vital for secure communication over unsecured networks. It provides robust encryption to ensure privacy and secure file transfers, making it an essential tool for remote server management and secure data communication. Known for its extensive security and authentication features, OpenSSH supports various encryption technologies and is standard on multiple Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenSSH&#8217;s implementation serves as a critical tool for secure communication. Its enterprise value lies in its scalability and the ability to enforce robust access controls and secure automated processes across various environments. This includes everything from automated backups and batch processing to complex DevOps practices, which involve the secure handling of sensitive data across multiple systems and locations. Its continued development and widespread adoption highlight its importance in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of network communications worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenSSH stands as a benchmark in software security, exemplifying a robust defense-in-depth approach. Despite the recent vulnerability, its overall track record remains exceptionally strong, serving as both a model and an inspiration in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"affected-openssh-versions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Affected OpenSSH versions:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>OpenSSH versions earlier than 4.4p1 are vulnerable to this signal handler race condition unless they are patched for CVE-2006-5051 and CVE-2008-4109.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Versions from 4.4p1 up to, but not including, 8.5p1 are not vulnerable due to a transformative patch for CVE-2006-5051, which made a previously unsafe function secure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The vulnerability resurfaces in versions from 8.5p1 up to, but not including, 9.8p1 due to the accidental removal of a critical component in a function.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenBSD systems are unaffected by this bug, as OpenBSD developed a secure mechanism in 2001 that prevents this vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"potential-impact-of-regresshion\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Potential Impact of regreSSHion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access. It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, gaining root access would enable attackers to bypass critical security mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and logging mechanisms, further obscuring their activities. This could also result in significant data breaches and leakage, giving attackers access to all data stored on the system, including sensitive or proprietary information that could be stolen or publicly disclosed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This vulnerability is challenging to exploit due to its remote race condition nature, requiring multiple attempts for a successful attack. This can cause memory corruption and necessitate overcoming Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Advancements in deep learning may significantly increase the exploitation rate, potentially providing attackers with a substantial advantage in leveraging such security flaws.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"immediate-steps-to-mitigate-risk\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Immediate Steps to Mitigate Risk</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing the regreSSHion vulnerability in OpenSSH, which enables remote code execution on Linux systems, demands a focused and layered security approach. Here are concise steps and strategic recommendations for enterprises to safeguard against this significant threat:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Patch Management</strong>: Quickly apply available patches for OpenSSH and prioritize ongoing update processes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhanced Access Control</strong>: Limit SSH access through network-based controls to minimize the attack risks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Network Segmentation and Intrusion Detection</strong>: Divide networks to restrict unauthorized access and lateral movements within critical environments and deploy systems to monitor and alert on unusual activities indicative of exploitation attempts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Custom Assessment and Remediation: </strong>Quickly execute mitigation script on required assets. To find out more, check out the FAQ section &#8216;Are there any mitigations for this vulnerability?&#8217;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"technical-details\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the technical details of this vulnerability at:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt\">https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"qualys-qid-coverage\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Qualys QID Coverage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualys is releasing the QIDs in the table below as they become available, starting with vulnsigs version VULNSIGS-2.6.83-4 and in Linux Cloud Agent manifest version LX_MANIFEST-2.6.83.4-5</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>QID</strong><strong></strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong><strong></strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;42046</td><td>&nbsp;OpenSSH Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution Vulnerability (regreSSHion)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Please check the Qualys Vulnerability Knowledgebase for the full list of coverage for this vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"discover-vulnerable-assets-using-qualys-cybersecurity-asset-management-csam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Discover Vulnerable Assets Using Qualys CyberSecurity Asset Management (CSAM)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial and crucial step in managing this critical vulnerability and mitigating associated risks involves pinpointing all assets susceptible to this specific issue.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) has discovered a Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in OpenSSH’s server (sshd) in glibc-based Linux systems. CVE assigned to this vulnerability is CVE-2024-6387.\nThe vulnerability, which is a signal handler race condition in OpenSSH’s server (sshd), allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as root on glibc-based Linux systems; that presents a significant security risk. This race condition affects sshd in its default configuration.\n\n\n\n\nBased on searches using Censys and Shodan, we have identified over 14 million potentially vulnerable OpenSSH server instances exposed to the Internet. Anonymized data from Qualys CSAM 3.0 with External Attack Surface Management data reveals that approximately 700,000 external internet-facing instances are vulnerable. This accounts for 31% of all internet-facing instances with OpenSSH in our global customer base. Interestingly, over 0.14% of vulnerable internet-facing instances with OpenSSH service have an End-Of-Life/End-Of-Support version of OpenSSH running.\nIn our security analysis, we identified that this vulnerability is a regression of the previously patched vulnerability CVE-2006-5051, which was reported in 2006. A regression in this context means that a flaw, once fixed, has reappeared in a subsequent software release, typically due to changes or updates that inadvertently reintroduce the issue. This incident highlights the crucial role of thorough regression testing to prevent the reintroduction of known vulnerabilities into the environment. This regression was introduced in October 2020 (OpenSSH 8.5p1).\nQualys has developed a working exploit for the regreSSHion vulnerability. As part of the disclosure process, we successfully demonstrated the exploit to the OpenSSH team to assist with their understanding and remediation efforts. We do not release our exploits, as we must allow time for patches to be applied. However, even though the exploit is complex, we believe that other independent researchers will be able to replicate our results.\nAbout OpenSSH: Securing Enterprise Communications and Infrastructure\nOpenSSH (Open Secure Shell) is a suite of secure networking utilities based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which is vital for secure communication over unsecured networks. It provides robust encryption to ensure privacy and secure file transfers, making it an essential tool for remote server management and secure data communication. Known for its extensive security and authentication features, OpenSSH supports various encryption technologies and is standard on multiple Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux.\nOpenSSH’s implementation serves as a critical tool for secure communication. Its enterprise value lies in its scalability and the ability to enforce robust access controls and secure automated processes across various environments. This includes everything from automated backups and batch processing to complex DevOps practices, which involve the secure handling of sensitive data across multiple systems and locations. Its continued development and widespread adoption highlight its importance in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of network communications worldwide.\nOpenSSH stands as a benchmark in software security, exemplifying a robust defense-in-depth approach. Despite the recent vulnerability, its overall track record remains exceptionally strong, serving as both a model and an inspiration in the field.\nAffected OpenSSH versions:\nOpenSSH versions earlier than 4.4p1 are vulnerable to this signal handler race condition unless they are patched for CVE-2006-5051 and CVE-2008-4109.\nVersions from 4.4p1 up to, but not including, 8.5p1 are not vulnerable due to a transformative patch for CVE-2006-5051, which made a previously unsafe function secure.\nThe vulnerability resurfaces in versions from 8.5p1 up to, but not including, 9.8p1 due to the accidental removal of a critical component in a function.\nOpenBSD systems are unaffected by this bug, as OpenBSD developed a secure mechanism in 2001 that prevents this vulnerability.\nPotential Impact of regreSSHion\nThis vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access. It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.\nMoreover, gaining root access would enable attackers to bypass critical security mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and logging mechanisms, further obscuring their activities. This could also result in significant data breaches and leakage, giving attackers access to all data stored on the system, including sensitive or proprietary information that could be stolen or publicly disclosed.\nThis vulnerability is challenging to exploit due to its remote race condition nature, requiring multiple attempts for a successful attack. This can cause memory corruption and necessitate overcoming Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Advancements in deep learning may significantly increase the exploitation rate, potentially providing attackers with a substantial advantage in leveraging such security flaws.\nImmediate Steps to Mitigate Risk\nAddressing the regreSSHion vulnerability in OpenSSH, which enables remote code execution on Linux systems, demands a focused and layered security approach. Here are concise steps and strategic recommendations for enterprises to safeguard against this significant threat:\nPatch Management: Quickly apply available patches for OpenSSH and prioritize ongoing update processes.\nEnhanced Access Control: Limit SSH access through network-based controls to minimize the attack risks.\nNetwork Segmentation and Intrusion Detection: Divide networks to restrict unauthorized access and lateral movements within critical environments and deploy systems to monitor and alert on unusual activities indicative of exploitation attempts.\nCustom Assessment and Remediation: Quickly execute mitigation script on required assets. To find out more, check out the FAQ section ‘Are there any mitigations for this vulnerability?’\nTechnical Details\nYou can find the technical details of this vulnerability at:  \nhttps://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt\nQualys QID Coverage\nQualys is releasing the QIDs in the table below as they become available, starting with vulnsigs version VULNSIGS-2.6.83-4 and in Linux Cloud Agent manifest version LX_MANIFEST-2.6.83.4-5\n\nQIDTitle\n\n 42046 OpenSSH Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution Vulnerability (regreSSHion)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease check the Qualys Vulnerability Knowledgebase for the full list of coverage for this vulnerability.\nDiscover Vulnerable Assets Using Qualys CyberSecurity Asset Management (CSAM)\nThe initial and crucial step in managing this critical vulnerability and mitigating associated risks involves pinpointing all assets susceptible to this specific issue.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "The polyfill.js is a popular open-source library that supports older browsers. Thousands of sites embed it using the cdn[.]polyfill[.]io domain. In February 2024, a Chinese company (Funnull) bought the domain and the GitHub account. The company has modified Polyfill.js so malicious code would be inserted into websites that embedded scripts from cdn.polyfill[.]io. Any script adopted from cdn.polyfill[.]io would immediately download malicious code from the Chinese company’s site. Some of the known outcomes are:\nuser would be redirected to scam sites,\nallows an attacker to steal sensitive data,\npotentially perform code execution. \nGiven that modern browsers do not require Polyfill, the original polyfill author recommends not to use Polyfill at all. All websites should remove any references to polyfill.io. Recommended alternatives are CDN, such as Cloudflare and Fastly.\n\n\n\n\nPolyfill.io Timeline:\n\n\n\n\nWhen Would a Website be Compromised?\n\n\n\n\nEfforts Done to Notify Users and Domain Owner:\nComplaints in GitHub (take precaution going to links listed in the archive): “https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873”\n\nWarnings were given from the original developer – https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975\n\nAlerts from Google by blocking sites that use “polyfill.io”\n\nAlternate solutions from Cloudflare, Fastly \nNotifications and warnings were ignored, the complaints on GitHub were removed, and the altered script continued to redirect users to malicious sites. \nSecure Your Website with Qualys:\nQualys provides a comprehensive continuous solution to detect security issues in organizations. You can discover all your applications in your organization using CSAM to ensure all the assets are scanned.

Note that these best practices also apply for other cloud environments, and to assist in maintaining the security of those environments, the following includes recommendations for Azure and GCP.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Access Key Rotation &#8211;</strong> Regularly rotate access keys to limit exposure in case of a breach. AWS recommends key rotation every 90 days. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to generate new keys and disable or delete old ones. Azure and GCP also support key rotation for security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid Hardcoding Credentials &#8211;</strong> Do not hardcode access keys and client secrets in your application code or scripts. Instead, utilize cloud-specific identity and access management services like IAM (AWS), Microsoft Entra ID (Azure), or Identity and Access Management (IAM) in GCP.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> &#8211; Enable MFA for accessing cloud accounts and managing access keys. This provides an additional layer of security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege &#8211;</strong> Assign permissions according to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and services have only the minimum required access to perform their tasks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Audit and Monitor &#8211;</strong> Activate the cloud provider&#8217;s monitoring and auditing services, such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, and GCP Audit Logs, to track access credential usage and detect suspicious activities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Secure Credential</strong> Storage &#8211; </strong>Securely store access keys and client secrets using the respective cloud&#8217;s key management services, like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Secret Manager. Avoid sharing keys via insecure methods like email.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limit Key Exposure &#8211;</strong> Minimize the exposure of access keys. Only provide access keys to those who need them, and never expose them to public repositories or web pages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Monitor Key Usage &#8211; </strong>Set up alerts or alarms for unusual access key usage patterns, such as unexpected increases in API calls or access from unique locations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Credential</strong> Deactivation &#8211; </strong>Promptly deactivate access keys or revoke client secrets that are compromised, or no longer needed, without deleting them. AWS, Azure, and GCP provide options to deactivate and revoke credentials for easy reactivation if required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Incident Response Plan</strong> &#8211; Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that includes specific steps for handling compromised access keys in each cloud provider.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"rates-of-misconfigured-access-keys-in-aws-environments\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rates of Misconfigured Access Keys in AWS Environments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate the current state of access key security, the Qualys research team has conducted an in-depth analysis of the average failure rates of AWS IAM-related controls, focusing mainly on access keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While your environment is unique, and you should make your own assessments of which best practices to focus on first, the following graph provides a comprehensive overview of misconfigurations, enabling users to assess and address security vulnerabilities effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full q-image-no-shadow\"><a data-fancybox href=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"901\" data-attachment-id=\"35802\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/06/19/totalcloud-insights-protect-your-aws-environment-by-managing-access-keys-securely/attachment/blog-graphics-3-1\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1200,901\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Blog-Graphics-3-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1-300x225.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1-1070x803.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35802\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1.png 1200w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1-300x225.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1-1070x803.png 1070w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Blog-Graphics-3-1-768x577.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"comprehensive-cloud-security-with-qualys-totalcloud\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comprehensive Cloud Security with Qualys TotalCloud</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the above misconfigurations and effectively secure access keys, <a href=\"https://www.qualys.com/apps/totalcloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Qualys TotalCloud</a> offers a robust set of controls designed to implement best practices and advanced preventive measures, fortifying cloud environments like AWS against misconfigurations.

The article then provides best practices to avoid these types of attacks, some data points around average failure rates of AWS IAM-related controls focused on access keys, and showcases the power of Qualys TotalCloud to secure against these types of misconfigurations.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are AWS access keys?\nAccess keys are essential credentials used for programmatic interactions with AWS services.

This could be used for sending phishing emails, spam, or other malicious content.\n\nService Disruption – Attackers could use this information to target an organization’s SES service to disrupt legitimate email communication by pushing the service to its limits.\n\n\nSocial Engineering – Knowledge of an organization’s email sending limits and usage could be used in social engineering attacks or to craft more convincing phishing emails.\nThe attacker also misused the “UpdateAccountSendingEnabled” API action. This is the action that allows users to turn email on or off across the entire Amazon SES account in the current AWS region. This action is used by legitimate users to manage their email-sending capabilities, ensuring compliance with AWS SES limits and controlling email sending for various use cases.\nHowever, if malicious actors gain unauthorized access to an AWS SES account, they can abuse the “UpdateAccountSendingEnabled” API action in several ways:\nEmail Flooding – Attackers can enable email sending without any restrictions, leading to the rapid and excessive sending of emails. This could be used for email flooding or spam campaigns, overwhelming recipient inboxes and potentially disrupting email services.\nPhishing Campaigns – Attackers can use the enabled sending capability to launch phishing campaigns, sending fraudulent emails that mimic trusted entities to deceive recipients and steal sensitive information.\nSpam Distribution – Enabling sending can allow attackers to distribute spam emails at scale, promoting malicious products, services, or links to unsuspecting recipients.\nHarassment – Attackers may use the “UpdateAccountSendingEnabled” action to send harassing or offensive content to specific individuals or organizations.\nResource Abuse – Continuous and excessive email sending can lead to resource abuse, causing AWS SES to incur additional costs and potentially violating AWS terms of service.\nBest Practices for Access Key Management\nHere are some best practices for managing access keys in cloud environments to prevent this kind of attack on an AWS environment. Note that these best practices also apply for other cloud environments, and to assist in maintaining the security of those environments, the following includes recommendations for Azure and GCP.\nAccess Key Rotation – Regularly rotate access keys to limit exposure in case of a breach. AWS recommends key rotation every 90 days. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to generate new keys and disable or delete old ones. Azure and GCP also support key rotation for security.\nAvoid Hardcoding Credentials – Do not hardcode access keys and client secrets in your application code or scripts. Instead, utilize cloud-specific identity and access management services like IAM (AWS), Microsoft Entra ID (Azure), or Identity and Access Management (IAM) in GCP.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Enable MFA for accessing cloud accounts and managing access keys. This provides an additional layer of security.\nPrinciple of Least Privilege – Assign permissions according to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and services have only the minimum required access to perform their tasks.\nAudit and Monitor – Activate the cloud provider’s monitoring and auditing services, such as AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, and GCP Audit Logs, to track access credential usage and detect suspicious activities.\nSecure Credential Storage – Securely store access keys and client secrets using the respective cloud’s key management services, like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Secret Manager. Avoid sharing keys via insecure methods like email.\nLimit Key Exposure – Minimize the exposure of access keys. Only provide access keys to those who need them, and never expose them to public repositories or web pages.\nMonitor Key Usage – Set up alerts or alarms for unusual access key usage patterns, such as unexpected increases in API calls or access from unique locations.\nCredential Deactivation – Promptly deactivate access keys or revoke client secrets that are compromised, or no longer needed, without deleting them. AWS, Azure, and GCP provide options to deactivate and revoke credentials for easy reactivation if required.\nIncident Response Plan – Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that includes specific steps for handling compromised access keys in each cloud provider.\nRates of Misconfigured Access Keys in AWS Environments\nTo illustrate the current state of access key security, the Qualys research team has conducted an in-depth analysis of the average failure rates of AWS IAM-related controls, focusing mainly on access keys.\nWhile your environment is unique, and you should make your own assessments of which best practices to focus on first, the following graph provides a comprehensive overview of misconfigurations, enabling users to assess and address security vulnerabilities effectively.\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive Cloud Security with Qualys TotalCloud\nTo address the above misconfigurations and effectively secure access keys, Qualys TotalCloud offers a robust set of controls designed to implement best practices and advanced preventive measures, fortifying cloud environments like AWS against misconfigurations. As highlighted below, our security best practices cover vital areas such as IAM (Identity and Access Management), public accessibility, logging, and more. These controls are meticulously aligned with industry-wide security standards, ensuring comprehensive protection for your infrastructure. Here are a few more notable examples:\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe incident described in this post is a stark reminder of the critical importance of safeguarding access keys and maintaining the security of cloud environments.\nBy consistently rotating keys, avoiding hardcoding, implementing multi-factor authentication, and following the principle of least privilege, you can significantly enhance the security of your cloud resources. Moreover, robust monitoring, secure key storage, and a well-prepared incident response plan are indispensable elements of a comprehensive security strategy. A solution like Qualys TotalCloud is a comprehensive way to implement these types of controls.\nIn today’s threat landscape, these best practices are critical for maintaining the highest level of protection for your cloud infrastructure.\nStart your Qualys TotalCloud experience to fortify your AWS environment against misconfigurations and take advantage of the best practices already programmed into the solution that will notify you when you need to take action to secure your access keys. \nContributors\nRahul Pareek, Security QA Engineer, Cloud, Qualys",

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Microsoft’s June Patch Tuesday is here, bringing fixes for vulnerabilities impacting its multiple products. This month’s release highlights the ongoing battle against cybersecurity threats, from critical updates to important fixes. Let’s dive into the crucial insights from Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday updates for June 2024.\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday for June 2024\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday’s June 2024 edition addressed 58 vulnerabilities, including one critical and 50 important severity vulnerabilities. In this month’s security updates, Microsoft has addressed one zero-day vulnerability known to be exploited in the wild. Microsoft also addressed seven vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based). The vulnerabilities have been patched earlier this month.\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday, June edition includes updates for vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and Components, Visual Studio, Windows Server Service, Windows Kernel, Windows DHCP Server, Azure Storage Library, Azure File Sync, and more.\nMicrosoft has fixed several flaws in multiple software, including Denial of Service (DoS), Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Information Disclosure, and Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n\n\n\nThe June 2024 Microsoft vulnerabilities are classified as follows:\n\nVulnerability CategoryQuantitySeverities\nDenial of Service Vulnerability5Important: 5\nElevation of Privilege Vulnerability25Important: 25\nInformation Disclosure Vulnerability3Important: 3\nRemote Code Execution Vulnerability18Critical: 1\nImportant: 17\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Patches for June 2024\nAdobe has released 10 security advisories to address 167 vulnerabilities in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Audition, Adobe Media Encoder, Adobe FrameMaker Publishing Server, Adobe Commerce, Adobe ColdFusion, Adobe Substance 3D Stager, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop, and Adobe Acrobat Android. Of the 167 vulnerabilities, 13 are given critical severity ratings. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to security feature bypass, privilege escalation, and arbitrary code execution.\nZero-day Vulnerability Patched in June Patch Tuesday Edition\nCVE-2023-50868: MITRE: CVE-2023-50868 NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust CPU\nThe vulnerability exists in DNSSEC validation that may allow an attacker to exploit standard DNSSEC protocols intended for DNS integrity by using excessive resources on a resolver, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.\nThis vulnerability was disclosed in February and patched in numerous DNS implementations.\nCritical Severity Vulnerability Patched in June Patch Tuesday Edition\nCVE-2024-30080: Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\nMessage Queuing (MSMQ) is a protocol developed by Microsoft to ensure reliable communication between Windows computers across different networks, even when a host is temporarily not connected (by maintaining a message queue of undelivered messages).\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must send a malicious MSMQ packet to an MSMQ server. On successful exploitation, an attacker may perform remote code execution on the server side.\nOther Microsoft Vulnerability Highlights\nCVE-2024-30082 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Win32k. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability may gain SYSTEM privileges.\nCVE-2024-35250 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Kernel-Mode Driver. On successful exploitation, an attacker may gain SYSTEM privileges.\nCVE-2024-30084 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Kernel-Mode Driver. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must win a race condition. On successful exploitation, an attacker may gain SYSTEM privileges.\nCVE-2024-30085 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability may gain SYSTEM privileges.\nCVE-2024-30086 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem. On successful exploitation, an attacker may gain SYSTEM privileges.\nCVE-2024-30087 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Win32k. An attacker would gain the rights of the user running the affected application.\nCVE-2024-30089 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Microsoft Streaming Service. On successful exploitation, an attacker may gain SYSTEM privileges.\nCVE-2024-30091 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Win32k. The attacker would gain the rights of the user running the affected application.\nCVE-2024-30088 and CVE-2024-30099 are elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows Kernel. To exploit them, an attacker must win a race condition. On successful exploitation, an attacker may gain SYSTEM privileges.\nMicrosoft Release Summary\nThis month’s release notes cover multiple Microsoft product families and products/versions affected, including, but not limited to, Windows Distributed File System (DFS), Windows Themes, Winlogon, Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, Windows Event Logging Service, Windows Link Layer Topology Discovery Protocol, Windows Container Manager Service, Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL, Windows Wi-Fi Driver, Windows Win32K – GRFX, Windows Standards-Based Storage Management Service, Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers, Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem, Windows NT OS Kernel, Microsoft Streaming Service, Windows Storage, Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), Windows Cryptographic Services, Microsoft Windows Speech, Microsoft Office SharePoint, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Office Word, Microsoft Office Outlook, Dynamics Business Central, Azure Monitor, Azure SDK, Microsoft Dynamics, Windows Perception Service, Azure Data Science Virtual Machines, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based).\nDiscover and Prioritize Vulnerabilities in Vulnerability Management, Detection & Response (VMDR)\nQualys VMDR automatically detects new Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities using continuous updates to its Knowledgebase (KB).\nYou can see all your impacted hosts by these vulnerabilities using the following QQL query:\nvulnerabilities.vulnerability: ( qid:`110467` OR qid:`110468` OR qid:`110469` OR qid:`379940` OR qid:`92142` OR qid:`92143` OR qid:`92144` OR qid:`92145` )\n\n\n\n\nRapid Response with Patch Management (PM)\nVMDR rapidly remediates Windows hosts by deploying the most relevant and applicable per-technology version patches. You can simply select respective QIDs in the Patch Catalog and filter on the “Missing” patches to identify and deploy the applicable, available patches with one click.\nThe following QQL will return the missing patches for this Patch Tuesday:\n( qid:`110467` OR qid:`110468` OR qid:`110469` OR qid:`379940` OR qid:`92142` OR qid:`92143` OR qid:`92144` OR qid:`92145`)\n\n\n\n\nEVALUATE Vendor-Suggested Mitigation with Policy Compliance (PC)\nWith Qualys Policy Compliance’s Out-of-the-Box Mitigation or Compensatory Controls, the risk of a vulnerability being exploited is reduced when the remediation (fix/patch) cannot be implemented immediately.\nQualys Policy Compliance team releases these exclusive controls based on vendor-suggested Mitigation/Workaround.\nMitigation refers to a setting, standard configuration, or general best-practice existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of the exploitation of a vulnerability.\nA workaround is sometimes used temporarily to achieve a task or goal when the usual or planned method isn’t working. Information technology often uses a workaround to overcome hardware, programming, or communication problems. Once a problem is fixed, a workaround is usually abandoned.\nThe following Qualys Policy Compliance Control IDs (CIDs), and System Defined Controls (SDC) have been updated to support Microsoft recommended mitigation(s) for this Patch Tuesday:\nCVE-2024-30080: Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\nCVSS:3.1 9.8 / 8.5\nPolicy Compliance Control IDs (CIDs):\n14297 Status of the open network connections and listening ports (Qualys Agent only)\n14916 Status of Windows Services\n4030 Status of the Windows Message Queuing Service\nThe following QQL will return a posture assessment for the CIDs for this Patch Tuesday:\ncontrol.id: [14297, 14916, 4030]\n\n\n\n\nCVE-2024-30070: DHCP Server Service Denial of Service Vulnerability\nCVSS:3.1 7.5 / 6.7\nPolicy Compliance Control IDs (CIDs):\n26238 Status of the DHCP Failover Configuration (Qualys Agent Only)\nThe following QQL will return a posture assessment for the CIDs for this Patch Tuesday:\ncontrol.id: [26238]\n\n\n\n\nThe next Patch Tuesday falls on July 9, and we’ll be back with details and patch analysis. Until next Patch Tuesday, stay safe and secure.

      "content:encoded": "\n<h2 id=\"introduction\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know there is a 90% failure rate for encryption-related controls of MySQL Server in Microsoft Azure? The issue isn&#8217;t confined to Azure; in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments there is a 98% failure rate of encryption-related controls for both compute engine and storage services. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is not exempt, with a LAMBDA failure rate of 71%, which indicates a significant gap in securing serverless functions, highlighting the need for users to enhance their understanding of encryption in these environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does This Mean?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s digital landscape, cloud computing platforms have become widespread. Organizations leverage the capabilities of cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP to store and process their data efficiently. Cloud service providers like the three mentioned above are responsible for the security &#8220;of the cloud&#8221; itself &#8211; the infrastructure, hardware, etc. However, customers bear responsibility for the security &#8220;in the cloud&#8221; &#8211; for safeguarding their sensitive data. As part of that responsibility, encrypting data in the cloud is fundamental, and implementing the best practices for AWS, Azure, and GCP is paramount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acknowledging the critical role of encryption in protecting your company&#8217;s data in the cloud, it is crucial to understand both how to set up encryption properly and that setting up encryption <strong>incorrectly</strong> can leave your data exposed to potential threats. Many cloud service providers (CSPs) have made encryption a standard feature, free of charge. Enabling encryption is often as easy as checking a box in your settings. It is surprising how often users overlook this simple yet essential security measure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog post, we list some failure rates for key services across CSPs, give you a little background on cloud encryption, offer a real-world scenario, and then suggest best practices to help you employ encryption for enhanced cloud security.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-35740\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"exploits-that-arise-due-to-lack-of-encryption\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exploits That Arise Due to Lack of Encryption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The severe risks associated with poor security controls, like leaving data unencrypted, have been brought to light in recent years in several security incidents, including: &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>An attack in January 2023 when a security researcher discovered that specific Google Cloud customers were utilizing <strong>unencrypted VM disks for critical workloads</strong>. Exploiting this misconfiguration, the researcher gained unauthorized access to customer financial information and intellectual property stored on these disks, resulting in the theft of sensitive data.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Last year, when <strong>sensitive flight data</strong>, including flight charts and PII, was exposed due to the lack of security measures on an Amazon S3 bucket linked to PegasusEFB&#8217;s EFB software, the software pilots use for navigation, to see crew information, etc. This breach could have been prevented by implementing security controls like encryption and access restrictions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>massive data breach Equifax suffered</strong> in 2017 due to the lack of data encryption, resulting in the exposure of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of over 148 million individuals. Encryption and proper monitoring could have significantly reduced the risk.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid these kinds of incidents and ensure data protection, regulatory compliance, and mitigation of insider threats, it is crucial that organizations employ encryption best practices, including encrypting virtual machine (VM) disks using Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEKs) for critical VMs within any cloud platform ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-failure-rates-of-encryption-related-controls\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Failure Rates of Encryption-Related Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to understand how we’re doing collectively in employing encryption and other related controls to see where we can improve the most. To that end, the Qualys research team analyzed encryption-related controls for widely used services across AWS, Azure, and GCP, revealing a fascinating landscape of strengths and areas needing improvement. In this analysis, &#8220;failure rates&#8221; refer to how often encryption-related controls failed for users of each cloud service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AWS Encryption

Addressing these areas of weakness is crucial for enhancing security and safeguarding data against emerging threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-cloud-encryption-and-how-does-it-safeguard-your-data\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Cloud Encryption, and How Does It Safeguard Your Data?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the failure rates above, we thought it worth diving into cloud encryption, and why and how it’s crucial to safeguarding data. Cloud encryption is a data security process that converts readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) before it is sent to or stored in the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud encryption ensures the protection of sensitive information, whether it is in transit over the internet or at rest in cloud storage. Encryption algorithms are employed to transform data of any type into an encoded format that is only decipherable with a specific decryption key. This means that even if an unauthorized entity intercepts or tries to steal the data, it remains useless to them unless they possess the decryption key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <strong>two primary states</strong> in which cloud encryption works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encrypting Data in Transit:</strong> This protects data as it moves between locations, often outside secure networks, making it vulnerable to interception. Typically, data in transit is automatically encrypted/decrypted using the HTTPS protocol with SSL.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Encrypting Data at Rest:</strong> This ensures that data stored in the cloud is virtually useless to anyone without the encryption key, even if lost, stolen, or mistakenly exposed. Keys are exclusively available to authorized users, and software applications manage encryption/decryption for data at rest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <strong>two primary types</strong> of data encryption used in the cloud:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> In this method, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it faster but somewhat less secure because anyone with access to the encryption key can decode the data. It is often used for bulk data encryption.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption:</strong><strong> </strong>This approach uses two keys, a public key and a private key, for encoding and decoding data. While these keys are related, they are not the same. Asymmetric encryption is more secure because public keys cannot expose private keys, and private keys do not need to be transmitted. It also serves as a form of authentication, allowing a sender to prove the origin of a file with a private key.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-benefits-of-cloud-data-encryption\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Benefits of Cloud Data Encryption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some of the ways cloud encryption ensures your data remains impervious to potential threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ensures Round the Clock Data Protection:</strong> Data is ever-changing, and attackers never rest, so the need to protect it is constant. Cloud encryption ensures your data is safeguarded 24/7, whether in transit or at rest in the cloud. This constant protection minimizes the risk and keeps your data safe.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mitigates Insider Threats:</strong> Insider threats can be as damaging as external ones. Cloud encryption is a robust defense mechanism that limits access to sensitive data exclusively to authorized personnel. This significantly reduces the risk of insider threats and ensures your data remains in trusted hands.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Overcomes Insecure APIs:</strong> Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are essential for modern cloud-based applications, but they often pose data security risks. Cloud encryption mitigates the risk by ensuring that even if APIs are compromised, the data they handle remains indecipherable without the encryption keys.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maintains Organizational Integrity:</strong> Data breaches can be disastrous for data security as well as an organization&#8217;s reputation and integrity. Cloud encryption provides an added layer of defense that can prevent data breaches from happening. And if your data remains secure, then you’ll never need to publicly disclose a breach, preserving your organization&#8217;s reputation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ensures Protection for Multiple Devices:</strong> In today&#8217;s mobile and remote work environment, data is accessed from many devices. Cloud encryption ensures that data remains secure regardless of the device used. This flexibility is invaluable for businesses embracing the digital age.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ensures Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:</strong> Compliance with data protection regulations is a non-negotiable aspect of modern business. Cloud encryption aligns with stringent encryption standards mandated by rules and regulations like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and FIPS. This not only keeps your data safe but also keeps your organization in compliance with the law.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, cloud encryption is a fundamental data protection measure in cloud environments, ensuring data security and privacy during transit and at rest through encryption algorithms. When it comes to safeguarding your valuable data, cloud encryption emerges as the stalwart defender you need, and there are many benefits of cloud encryption in elevating your data security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"scenario-based-example-of-security-risks\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scenario-based Example of Security Risks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The image below will give insight into how cloud-based environments are usually designed. The environment is based on the AWS cloud and depicts data exchange among different resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) consists of 2 subnets, one public and the other a private subnet, each containing an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The public EC2 instance stores some data in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), fetched quickly by the AWS Lambda service and sent to the Amazon S3 bucket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S3 bucket hosts static website content that is distributed using the Amazon CloudFront service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image q-image-no-shadow\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"939\" height=\"573\" data-attachment-id=\"35758\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/06/04/totalcloud-insights-securing-your-data-the-power-of-encryption-in-preventing-threats/attachment/image-6-1\" data-orig-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"939,573\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-6-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6-1-300x183.png\" data-large-file=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6-1.png\" src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35758\" style=\"width:669px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6-1.png 939w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6-1-300x183.png 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6-1-768x469.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Below are some points that highlight the areas in this scenario where security risks, including lack of encryption, might be present:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The EC2 instance is <a>public-facing</a>, making it accessible over the internet. The instance can also connect to the RDS database, which, if not password-protected, can be used to access the stored data.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the RDS database is also publicly accessible, and if not protected, the lack of encryption can expose the stored data.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The S3 Bucket Policy governs the permissions on the bucket. If not restricted, it allows anyone to access and manipulate the data residing in the S3 bucket. The bucket policies should also enforce encryption of data in transit.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>S3 Bucket hosts static website content delivered using CloudFront distributions over HTTP protocol. The insecure protocol makes the website and any information it hosts vulnerable to attack.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent the risks presented by lack of or poor encryption in this scenario and others presented in a multi-cloud environment, it’s best to employ certain security best practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"security-best-practices-for-data-encryption\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Security Best Practices for Data Encryption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some security best practices for data encryption in various CSPs, along with Qualys Control IDs (also called CIDs), that will help strengthen the cloud security posture of these CSPs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Amazon Web Services (AWS):&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS): AWS KMS allows you to create and control encryption keys for your data.

Cloud service providers like the three mentioned above are responsible for the security “of the cloud” itself – the infrastructure, hardware, etc. However, customers bear responsibility for the security “in the cloud” – for safeguarding their sensitive data. As part of that responsibility, encrypting data in the cloud is fundamental, and implementing the best practices for AWS, Azure, and GCP is paramount.\nAcknowledging the critical role of encryption in protecting your company’s data in the cloud, it is crucial to understand both how to set up encryption properly and that setting up encryption incorrectly can leave your data exposed to potential threats. Many cloud service providers (CSPs) have made encryption a standard feature, free of charge. Enabling encryption is often as easy as checking a box in your settings. It is surprising how often users overlook this simple yet essential security measure. \nIn this blog post, we list some failure rates for key services across CSPs, give you a little background on cloud encryption, offer a real-world scenario, and then suggest best practices to help you employ encryption for enhanced cloud security.\n\n\n\n\nExploits That Arise Due to Lack of Encryption\nThe severe risks associated with poor security controls, like leaving data unencrypted, have been brought to light in recent years in several security incidents, including:  \nAn attack in January 2023 when a security researcher discovered that specific Google Cloud customers were utilizing unencrypted VM disks for critical workloads. Exploiting this misconfiguration, the researcher gained unauthorized access to customer financial information and intellectual property stored on these disks, resulting in the theft of sensitive data. \nLast year, when sensitive flight data, including flight charts and PII, was exposed due to the lack of security measures on an Amazon S3 bucket linked to PegasusEFB’s EFB software, the software pilots use for navigation, to see crew information, etc. This breach could have been prevented by implementing security controls like encryption and access restrictions.\nThe massive data breach Equifax suffered in 2017 due to the lack of data encryption, resulting in the exposure of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of over 148 million individuals. Encryption and proper monitoring could have significantly reduced the risk.\nTo avoid these kinds of incidents and ensure data protection, regulatory compliance, and mitigation of insider threats, it is crucial that organizations employ encryption best practices, including encrypting virtual machine (VM) disks using Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEKs) for critical VMs within any cloud platform ecosystem.\nThe Failure Rates of Encryption-Related Controls\nWe wanted to understand how we’re doing collectively in employing encryption and other related controls to see where we can improve the most. To that end, the Qualys research team analyzed encryption-related controls for widely used services across AWS, Azure, and GCP, revealing a fascinating landscape of strengths and areas needing improvement. In this analysis, “failure rates” refer to how often encryption-related controls failed for users of each cloud service.\nAWS Encryption Controls:\nFigure 1: Failure Rate of AWS Controls with respect to encryption.\n\n\n\n\nAWS reveals mixed results in implementing encryption best practices:\nLAMBDA: A 71% failure rate indicates a significant gap in securing serverless functions, highlighting the need for users to enhance their understanding of encryption in these environments.\nCloudTrail: With a 64% failure rate, potential vulnerabilities in logging and monitoring services are highlighted, underscoring the importance of improving encryption practices.\nEC2: A 46% failure rate suggests moderate concerns in virtual computing environments, where users could improve their grasp of encryption measures.\nAPI Gateway: A 43% failure rate reveals room for improvement in securing API endpoints, indicating a need for users to strengthen their encryption strategies.\nRDS: At 41%, managed database services show relatively better adherence to encryption practices, but there is still significant room for improvement and a need for increased focus on encryption protocols.\nAzure Encryption Controls:\nFigure 2: Failure Rate of Azure Controls with respect to encryption.\nAzure demonstrates higher challenges in encryption across several key services, emphasizing a critical need for enhanced security measures:\nVirtual Machine: A 54% failure rate suggests a need for stronger encryption practices in virtualized resources, indicating that users should improve their understanding and application of encryption.\nStorage Account: With a 75% failure rate, significant risks to data storage solutions are evident, pointing to the necessity for users to enhance their grasp of encryption techniques.\nMySQL Server: A concerning 90% failure rate highlights major gaps in database server security, emphasizing the need for users to better understand and implement encryption best practices.\nDisk: At 93%, encryption practices in persistent storage devices are notably lacking, calling for users to significantly improve their encryption measures.\nGCP Encryption Controls:\nFigure 3: Failure Rate of GCP Controls with respect to encryption.\nGCP exhibits alarmingly high failure rates in encryption practices, particularly in data processing and storage services:\nBig Query: A staggering 99% failure rate suggests widespread issues in securing data analytics services, highlighting an urgent need for users to better grasp encryption practices.\nCompute Engine: With a 98% failure rate, there are severe deficiencies in encrypting virtual machines, underscoring the necessity for users to improve their understanding of encryption.\nStorage: Another 98% failure rate points to significant vulnerabilities in cloud storage, indicating that users need to substantially enhance encryption strategies.\nDataproc: A 90% failure rate highlights substantial risks in data processing services, emphasizing the importance for users to increase their grasp of encryption measures.\nSQL: At 76%, there are considerable gaps in securing SQL databases, suggesting that users need to focus more on understanding and implementing robust encryption practices.\nThese insights highlight the pressing need for a stronger grasp of encryption practices across all cloud platforms. Addressing these areas of weakness is crucial for enhancing security and safeguarding data against emerging threats.\nWhat Is Cloud Encryption, and How Does It Safeguard Your Data?\nWith the failure rates above, we thought it worth diving into cloud encryption, and why and how it’s crucial to safeguarding data. Cloud encryption is a data security process that converts readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) before it is sent to or stored in the cloud.\nCloud encryption ensures the protection of sensitive information, whether it is in transit over the internet or at rest in cloud storage. Encryption algorithms are employed to transform data of any type into an encoded format that is only decipherable with a specific decryption key. This means that even if an unauthorized entity intercepts or tries to steal the data, it remains useless to them unless they possess the decryption key.\nThere are two primary states in which cloud encryption works:\nEncrypting Data in Transit: This protects data as it moves between locations, often outside secure networks, making it vulnerable to interception. Typically, data in transit is automatically encrypted/decrypted using the HTTPS protocol with SSL.\nEncrypting Data at Rest: This ensures that data stored in the cloud is virtually useless to anyone without the encryption key, even if lost, stolen, or mistakenly exposed. Keys are exclusively available to authorized users, and software applications manage encryption/decryption for data at rest.\nThere are two primary types of data encryption used in the cloud:\nSymmetric Encryption: In this method, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it faster but somewhat less secure because anyone with access to the encryption key can decode the data. It is often used for bulk data encryption.\nAsymmetric Encryption: This approach uses two keys, a public key and a private key, for encoding and decoding data. While these keys are related, they are not the same. Asymmetric encryption is more secure because public keys cannot expose private keys, and private keys do not need to be transmitted. It also serves as a form of authentication, allowing a sender to prove the origin of a file with a private key.\nThe Benefits of Cloud Data Encryption\nBelow are some of the ways cloud encryption ensures your data remains impervious to potential threats.\nEnsures Round the Clock Data Protection: Data is ever-changing, and attackers never rest, so the need to protect it is constant. Cloud encryption ensures your data is safeguarded 24/7, whether in transit or at rest in the cloud. This constant protection minimizes the risk and keeps your data safe.\nMitigates Insider Threats: Insider threats can be as damaging as external ones. Cloud encryption is a robust defense mechanism that limits access to sensitive data exclusively to authorized personnel. This significantly reduces the risk of insider threats and ensures your data remains in trusted hands.\nOvercomes Insecure APIs: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are essential for modern cloud-based applications, but they often pose data security risks. Cloud encryption mitigates the risk by ensuring that even if APIs are compromised, the data they handle remains indecipherable without the encryption keys.\nMaintains Organizational Integrity: Data breaches can be disastrous for data security as well as an organization’s reputation and integrity. Cloud encryption provides an added layer of defense that can prevent data breaches from happening. And if your data remains secure, then you’ll never need to publicly disclose a breach, preserving your organization’s reputation.\nEnsures Protection for Multiple Devices: In today’s mobile and remote work environment, data is accessed from many devices. Cloud encryption ensures that data remains secure regardless of the device used. This flexibility is invaluable for businesses embracing the digital age.\nEnsures Compliance and Regulatory Requirements: Compliance with data protection regulations is a non-negotiable aspect of modern business. Cloud encryption aligns with stringent encryption standards mandated by rules and regulations like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and FIPS. This not only keeps your data safe but also keeps your organization in compliance with the law.\nIn summary, cloud encryption is a fundamental data protection measure in cloud environments, ensuring data security and privacy during transit and at rest through encryption algorithms. When it comes to safeguarding your valuable data, cloud encryption emerges as the stalwart defender you need, and there are many benefits of cloud encryption in elevating your data security.\nScenario-based Example of Security Risks\nThe image below will give insight into how cloud-based environments are usually designed. The environment is based on the AWS cloud and depicts data exchange among different resources. \nThe Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) consists of 2 subnets, one public and the other a private subnet, each containing an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. The public EC2 instance stores some data in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), fetched quickly by the AWS Lambda service and sent to the Amazon S3 bucket. \nThe S3 bucket hosts static website content that is distributed using the Amazon CloudFront service. \n\nBelow are some points that highlight the areas in this scenario where security risks, including lack of encryption, might be present:\nThe EC2 instance is public-facing, making it accessible over the internet. The instance can also connect to the RDS database, which, if not password-protected, can be used to access the stored data. \nSimilarly, the RDS database is also publicly accessible, and if not protected, the lack of encryption can expose the stored data. \nThe S3 Bucket Policy governs the permissions on the bucket. If not restricted, it allows anyone to access and manipulate the data residing in the S3 bucket. The bucket policies should also enforce encryption of data in transit. \nS3 Bucket hosts static website content delivered using CloudFront distributions over HTTP protocol. The insecure protocol makes the website and any information it hosts vulnerable to attack.  \nTo prevent the risks presented by lack of or poor encryption in this scenario and others presented in a multi-cloud environment, it’s best to employ certain security best practices.\nSecurity Best Practices for Data Encryption\nBelow are some security best practices for data encryption in various CSPs, along with Qualys Control IDs (also called CIDs), that will help strengthen the cloud security posture of these CSPs.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS): \nUse AWS Key Management Service (KMS): AWS KMS allows you to create and control encryption keys for your data. You can use it to encrypt data at rest, in transit, and manage access. \nQualys TotalCloud Control ID: 203\nEnable Server-Side Encryption: Use server-side encryption options for services like Amazon S3, RDS, and EBS. AWS handles key management and encryption for you. \nQualys TotalCloud Control ID: 168   \nImplement Encryption in Transit: Use protocols like SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit. This is crucial for securing data between your AWS services and clients.\nQualys TotalCloud Control ID: 252   \nMicrosoft Azure: \nAzure Key Vault: Use Azure Key Vault for secure key management. It provides a central repository for your encryption keys and secrets.\nQualys TotalCloud Control ID: 50230       \nTransport Layer Security (TLS): Configure your applications to use TLS for data in transit. Azure provides tools for creating and managing SSL certificates.\nQualys TotalCloud Control ID: 50365  \nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP):\nGoogle Cloud Key Management Service (KMS): Use Google Cloud KMS to create and manage encryption keys for your data.\nQualys TotalCloud Control ID: 52005    \nData Encryption at Rest: Enable encryption at rest for Google Cloud Storage and Google Compute Engine. GCP handles the key management. \nQualys TotalCloud Control ID: 52117   \nEnhancing Cloud Security with Qualys TotalCloud\nIn our research, we examined data from big cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP. We found that many basic security settings are often overlooked by the cloud users. This oversight is significant for cloud protection. It may occur due to a lack of security planning, unfamiliarity with the latest technology, or unawareness of the associated risks.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "Summary\nThe Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) can be vulnerable to data compromise when a Compute Engine cluster is in a public-facing virtual private cloud (VPC) or shares the VPC with other Compute Engine instances.\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) provides a default VPC called ‘default.’ This VPC allows inbound connections only on ports 22 and 3389 while permitting all inbound connections within the internal subnet. This configuration can pose a significant security risk when both Dataproc clusters and Compute Engine instances share the default subnet VPC. It can lead to potential data corruption or theft, both serious concerns.\nThe Google Security Team labeled the attack flow as an ‘Abuse Risk.’\nQualys TotalCloud now notifies customers of misconfigured Dataproc clusters that are vulnerable to exploitation, offering remediation steps and code for prompt resolution.\nWhy This Vulnerability is Important to Understand\nSecurity vulnerabilities pose significant challenges in the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud computing. The recent discovery of an unauthenticated access vulnerability in Google Cloud Dataproc underscores the need for robust cloud security measures.\nThis risk to Google Cloud Dataproc clusters can lead to data theft, manipulation, or loss. The underlying Open-Source Software (OSS) managed solution lacks adequate security controls, enabling unauthorized access by attackers with knowledge of the Dataproc IP address.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle’s Dataproc documentation highlights the security risk associated with open firewall rules on public networks and recommends caution in setting them up. However, it also emphasizes the need for vigilance against potential attackers who might gain initial access to a Compute Engine instance, as this could allow them unauthenticated access to GCP Dataproc. This scenario underscores the importance of robust security measures at all access points to safeguard against unauthorized access.\nTo shed light on this issue and help organizations enhance their security posture, in this post the Qualys TotalCloud team aims to analyze the attack flow comprehensively and offer recommendations for minimizing the associated risks.\nWhat is the Google Cloud Dataproc Service?\nGoogle Cloud Dataproc is a managed cloud service specially designed for seamless deployment and efficient management of Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters. This service caters to large-scale data processing and analytics workloads, utilizing Hadoop for distributed storage and batch processing and Spark for in-memory data processing and analytics.\nUnderstanding the Vulnerability\nThe GCP Dataproc threat exploits two critical weaknesses:\nThe absence of security controls in Apache Hadoop’s web interfaces and\nThe tendency to rely on default settings when creating resources.\nThese vulnerabilities combine to allow an attacker unimpeded access to the Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and the ability to then compromise sensitive data.\nTwo key web interfaces on the master node facilitate this exploitation: YARN ResourceManager on port 8088 and HDFS NameNode on port 9870. Alarmingly, neither interface requires authentication despite their crucial role in the cluster’s operation. The HDFS endpoint is particularly risky, being the primary storage system for the entire cluster. Both ports mentioned above serve all IP addresses, effectively granting internet access as the sole prerequisite to full access. Consequently, an insufficiently segmented cluster can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nHDFS NameNode on port 9870\n\n\n\nYARN ResourceManager on port 8088\n\n\n\nThe GCP Dataproc Attack Flow \n\n\n\n\nWhile it may be challenging to prevent the occurrence of an internet-facing Compute Engine instance vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE), organizations should prioritize risk mitigation.\nThis blog outlines a potential attack path, assuming an external attacker has fully compromised such an instance, allowing them to scan for open ports. If a Dataproc cluster shares the same VPC, the consequences can be dire, granting the attacker unrestricted access to unauthorized services.\nThe attacker gains access to both web interfaces by exploiting the compromised machine as a tunnel. They can utilize the YARN endpoint to create applications, submit jobs, and perform Cloud Storage operations. Alternatively, using the HDFS endpoint, the attacker can navigate the storage file system freely, potentially obtaining sensitive data.\nIt’s important to note that this attack flow is not limited to vulnerable Compute Engine instances. Any workload, such as Cloud Run or AppEngine, deployed on the same VPC network as the Hadoop master node can expose the HDFS data if compromised, facilitating the same level of exploitation.\nEvaluating HDFS NameNode Accessibility: GCP’s Vulnerability vs. AWS and Azure Security\nIn the context of HDFS NameNode accessibility, a significant vulnerability emerges in GCP Dataproc, notably absent in AWS EMR and Azure HDInsight. This variance underscores differing security paradigms in these cloud platforms.\nGCP Dataproc Vulnerability\nOn the one hand, the Google Cloud Platform offers a secure method to access the HDFS NameNode through the Dataproc Web Interfaces within the Google Cloud Console.
